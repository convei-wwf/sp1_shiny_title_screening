**Screening question 3b: Does the title and/or abstract attribute/link the benefit/value to the application/use of a specific dataset or data source (EO or otherwise)?**

**Includes:**

* Valuation methodology *applied to one or more datasets*, e.g., value of information (VOI), cost-benefit analysis, contingent valuation, revealed preference, value chain analysis, willingness to pay (WTP).  These (and variations) are all standard methodologies for estimating the value of information or data.
    * **Include** e.g., Perhans, K. et al. (2014) [The value of information in conservation planning: Selecting retention trees for lichen conservation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811271400022X): this paper applies a *Value of Information methodology to assess the value of certain types of information about trees* (lichen presence, bark and stem attributes).
    * **Include** e.g., Moltchanova, Elena et al. (2011). [The Value Of Rapid Damage Assessment For Efficient Earthquake Response](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753511000786): The authors develop an approach to assess the *value of information with respect to spatial damage distribution data* (to improve timely arrival of response rescue teams after an earthquake).
* Comparison of the *performance of one or more datasets* against a counterfactual (e.g., different policy, method, data, or historical baseline), to show some *improvement* in estimating some value of interest (e.g., improvement through improved accuracy or reduced uncertainty) in relative or absolute terms.
    * **Include** e.g., Howe et al. (2022): [Comparing Sentinel-2 And Landsat 8 For Burn Severity Mapping In Western North America]( ): this document compares performance of Sentinel-2 data against a counterfactual of Landsat-8 data to estimate a relative improvement in burn severity mapping.  This meets criterion 3b as it is comparing performance of one dataset against a counterfactual.  The resulting improvement in burn severity mapping is *attributed to the improved spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data*.
    * **Include** e.g., Fatehkia, M. et al. (2020) [The Relative Value Of Facebook Advertising Data For Poverty Mapping](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7361): This study compares satellite data against Facebook ad data for mapping socioeconomic development in India and the Philippines.  This meets criterion 3b; the Facebook data could be considered a counterfactual to the satellite data.  The *difference in performance of poverty mapping can be attributed to the use of satellite data vs. Facebook data* (though the authors frame it in the opposite direction: "we evaluate the added value of using Facebook data over satellite data...").
* Mention of *valuation of data or information* as a primary goal (valuation methodology need not be described).

**Excludes:**

* Comparison of performance of different *models/analyses* but applied to the same dataset.  This would determine value of the *model* rather than the *data*.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Li, C. (2017) [Statistical Object-Based Method For Forest Change Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](http://www.linyekexue.net/EN/10.11707/j.1001-7488.20170509): the authors apply a statistical procedure to a set of satellite images to identify forest change; they apply different confidence levels to see how the detection accuracy changed.  But the value in improved accuracy is attributable to the changes in the *model*, not to the data itself.
* Validating the accuracy of an EO-based method against some other method (EO or otherwise) - essentially demonstrating *equivalent* accuracy/confidence, rather than an *improvement*.  Without further explicit elaboration on why this is valuable (e.g., cost reductions, value of decisions based on more frequent access or higher resolution), the value is merely implicit.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Tayfehrostami, Arash et al. (2023) [Analyzing The Variations In The Water Surface Area Of Taleqan Dam Of Iran Using Ground-Based And Satellite Observations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10064509): the authors compare water surface area results derived from Sentinel images to in-situ observations, and show the satellite method is pretty accurate.  However, there is no indication of how valuable this would be to managers making decisions about water resources, relative to the current methods.
    **Exclude** E.g., Rivas-Fandino, Paula et al. (2023). ["Assessment Of High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery For Monitoring Riparian Vegetation: Riverine Management In The Smallholding"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-022-10667-8) seeks to assess the viability of satellite imagery for monitoring riparian ecosystems.  The authors show that satellite imagery can reasonably be used to estimate indices of riparian ecosystem quality, but only vaguely gesturing at value ("facilitate the environmental governance of multiple ecosystems").
* Valuation of some result or outcome that is not data or information.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Kindu, Mengistie et al. (2016) [Changes Of Ecosystem Service Values In Response To Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics In Munessa-Shashemene Landscape Of The Ethiopian Highlands](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969715312821): the authors quantify the loss of ecosystem service value (ESV) due to land use/land change, using remote observation data.  However, the valuation of the ESV losses is *attributed to LULC*, rather than attributable to the *data* used to measure those losses.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Sharma, Sonali et al. (2020) [A Long-Term And Comprehensive Assessment Of Urbanization-Induced Impacts On Ecosystem Services In The Capital City Of India](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590252020300283): As above, the authors value changes in ESV using EO data, but do not attempt to estimate the value of the *data* itself.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Ratzke, Leonie (2023) [Revealing Preferences For Urban Biodiversity As An Environmental Good](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800923001477): The author uses a revealed preference approach to estimate urban dwellers' willingness to pay for improved biodiversity.  This results in a valuation of *biodiversity*, rather than data.
* Application of data in pursuit of societal benefits/goals/insights, but with no mention of valuation of data.
    * Application indicates there is *implicit* value - otherwise the data would not be used!  However, this is not sufficient.  Some effort or methodology to tease out the value attributable to a set of data or information must be indicated.
    * **Exclude** E.g., Kanniah, K. D. (2016). [Multi-Sensor Satellite Data For Carbon Storage Mapping Of Green Space In A Fast Growing Development Corridor In Malaysia](https://a-a-r-s.org/proceeding/ACRS2016/ACRS%202016%20Oral%20Papers/TS9/Ab%200018.pdf): this study estimates value of carbon storage due to green space (as fraction of emitted carbon).  The study used on-the-ground sampling to parameterize allometric models of above-ground forest biomass (AGB), and then compared these to satellite imagery to estimate AGB across a broad region.  The satellite data were necessary to complete the analysis, but there is no indication that the author estimated the "value added" contribution of the satellite data itself (e.g., compared to other methods).
