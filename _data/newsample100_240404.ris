TI  - Journaling And The Creative Writing Workshop In Counseling And Recovery Of Adult Participants
AB  - Background. I discuss a method of facilitation that I have used in my Creative Writing courses at the University of Lethbridge for many years. I tend to focus primarily on potentials and possibilities in third-year courses and then move on to questions of forms, genre, and structure in the. Advanced. or exit-year courses. These courses rely heavily on rapport and a specific structure which has the effect (most of the time) of opening the spigot of the students' creative energies. Purpose of Study. Data from this pedagogy is plotted in a qualitative exploration using in-depth phenomenological. prompts. or thought experiments. This data will be presented in order to depict how art making or (in this case, Creative Writing journaling) contributes to mental health recovery and stability. The hope of our team is that this method may be deploy at a downtown satellite program open to street people and all and any who seek help. Sources of Evidence. An interpretative phenomenological approach is applied to data collected in several years of Creative Writing workshops at the University of Lethbridge. This data is broken down into three main categories: explanatory models of how the skills, qualities and approaches of the facilitator assisted recovery, on transformative characteristics of art making in this particular venue, and the wider social benefits of such art making. Main Argument. Using collaborative techniques grounded on the premise that the workshop is unconditionally a. safe place,. a progressive conversation is established in which the matter of the self is drawn into both language that is fresh and control of language that holistically conforms to the group dynamic. In this dynamic, remarkable recoveries may take place. I will focus the discussion on the structure of the collaborative journalizing, the purpose of which is to bring structure into the very production of personal and creative recovery. The journaling is an extended process-meditation, begun on the first day of a half-semester course and finished on the day a final portfolio is submitted for grading. I argue that the dream-journaling should have a basic structure in any case, and discuss several such schema as they have been used not only in Creative Writing but also in the community and in the literature of counselling and guidance. Conclusions. The findings provide a initial but profound exploration into art facilitators' pragmatic knowledge and wisdom related to the health and recovery benefits of art making in the area of counselling and guidance. It also explores important skills and competencies required by those facilitating art making programs in mental health recovery contexts. Such data may help to inform policy and design of health recovery programs associated with Creative Writing workshops both in the college or university setting as well as the community health unit.

TI  - Scenario Analysis For The San Pedro River, Analyzing Hydrological Consequences Of A Future Environment
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Studies of future management and policy options based on different assumptions provide a mechanism to examine possible Outcomes and especially their likely benefits and consequences. The San Pedro River in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico is an area that has undergone rapid changes in land use and cover, and subsequently is facing keen environmental crises related to water resources. It is the location of a number of studies that have dealt with change analysis, watershed condition, and most recently, alternative futures analysis. The previous work has dealt primarily with resources of habitat, visual quality, and groundwater related to urban development patterns and preferences. In the present study, previously defined future scenarios, in the form of land-use/land-cover grids, were examined relative to their impact on surface-water conditions (e.g., surface runoff and sediment yield). These hydrological outputs were estimated for the baseline year of 2000 and predicted twenty years in the future as a demonstration of how new geographic information system-based hydrologic modeling tools can be used to evaluate the spatial impacts of urban growth patterns on surface-water hydrology.

TI  - Soil Erodibility Mapping Using The Rusle Model To Prioritize Erosion Control In The Wadi Sahouat Basin, North-West Of Algeria
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Soil losses must be quantified over watersheds in order to set up protection measures against erosion. The main objective of this paper is to quantify and to map soil losses in the Wadi Sahouat basin (2140 km(2)) in the north-west of Algeria, using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model assisted by a Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing. The Model Builder of the GIS allowed the automation of the different operations for establishing thematic layers of the model parameters: the erosivity factor (R), the erodibility factor (K), the topographic factor (LS), the crop management factor (C), and the conservation support practice factor (P). The average annual soil loss rate in the Wadi Sahouat basin ranges from 0 to 255 t ha(-1) year(-1), maximum values being observed over steep slopes of more than 25\% and between 600 and 1000 m elevations. 3.4\% of the basin is classified as highly susceptible to erosion, 4.9\% with a medium risk, and 91.6\% at a low risk. Google Earth reveals a clear conformity with the degree of zones to erosion sensitivity. Based on the soil loss map, 32 subbasins were classified into three categories by priority of intervention: high, moderate, and low. This priority is available to sustain a management plan against sediment filling of the Ouizert damat the basin outlet. The method enhancing the RUSLE model and confrontation with Google Earth can be easily adapted to other watersheds.

TI  - Developing Shopping And Dining Walking Indices Using Pois And Remote Sensing Data
JO  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Walking is one of the most commonly promoted traveling methods and is garnering increasing attention. Many indices/scores have been developed by scholars to measure the walkability in a local community. However, most existing walking indices/scores involve urban planning-oriented, local service-oriented, regional accessibility-oriented, and physical activity-oriented walkability assessments. Since shopping and dining are two major leisure activities in our daily lives, more attention should be given to the shopping or dining-oriented walking environment. Therefore, we developed two additional walking indices that focus on shopping or dining. The point of interest (POI), vegetation coverage, water coverage, distance to bus/subway station, and land surface temperature were employed to construct walking indices based on 50-m street segments. Then, walking index values were categorized into seven recommendation levels. The field verification illustrates that the proposed walking indices can accurately represent the walking environment for shopping and dining. The results in this study could provide references for citizens seeking to engage in activities of shopping and dining with a good walking environment.

JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The availability of environmental and Earth resources data acquired by satellites can assist all countries to gain a better understanding of how to safeguard their environment as well as ensure a more efficient management and productive harnessing of their natural resources. However, in order for the developing countries to share in the benefits inherent in remote sensing technology and in programmes related to environmental information systems, particularly through their participation in international, regional and national programmes and projects, there must be an adequate and long-term commitment to and an investment in the development of skills and knowledge in the discipline at the local level. This article focuses on the United Nations initiative to establish regional Centres for Space Science and Technology Education which should provide a unique opportunity for the development of such an indigenous capability. These Centres have the potential to contribute significantly to the implementation of the recommendations of the Rio Conference, otherwise known as Agenda 21, and to the successful execution of the programme of activities of the user communities in the developing countries.

TI  - What Happened In Finland To Increase Home Hemodialysis?
JO  - Hemodialysis International
AB  - Finland is geographically a rather large country with a relatively sparse population (5.3 million). Home hemodialysis (HHD) was started in Helsinki 40 years ago and in the early years it was only used in selected patients. However, by the late 1980s HHD almost disappeared owing to the advent of CAPD and new HD centers. Towards the end of the 1990s, it became evident that PD had limitations and new ways had to be found to individualize HD, improve the outcome, increase capacity, and limit the growth of costs of HD. After careful planning, HHD was reinstituted at the Helsinki University Hospital in 1998 and since then the program has grown steadily. By December 31, 2007, altogether 163 patients had started at home. This has required changes in the predialysis program where the "home first" policy was adopted. Other important features include close cooperation with other nephrological centers as well as centralized HHD training that also supports more remote hospitals. Since then this therapy has been started in several other academic and in some smaller hospitals, and at the end of last year about 4%5 of all Finnish dialysis patients (n=1.600) were on HHD (prevalence 11.8/million). In the Helsinki metropolitan area this treatment is the most economical modality (estimated annual global costs €37.000), comparable to self-care satellite HD and CAPD. A successful HHD program requires a well-organized predialysis program, a highly motivated multidisciplinary team, and well-developed training networks. © Journal compilation © 2008 International Society for Hemodialysis.

TI  - Thermal Environment Change Initiated By Development Of Puxiazhou Wetlands In Fuzhou
JO  - Wetland Science
AB  - Urban build-up areas have been overdeveloped with the accelerated urbanization process in China. This has caused significant degradation of regional eco-environment. In order to study the thermal environmental change initiated by the development of Puxiazhou wetlands in Fuzhou, Southeast China, the part of the wetlands was developed to a local exhibitation center, two Landsat TM images in 2006 and 2010 were utilized to perform feature extraction of thermal-related information of the wetlands. The extracted feature information included built-up land, fractional vegetation coverage, wetness, and land surface temperature. The analysis on the changes of the above thermal-related feature information revealed that the development of the wetlands to the exhibition center had caused the reduction of wetness and fractional vegetation coverage by 10.00% and 25.64%, respectively, and the increase in built-up index value by 13.85%. Consequently, the land surface temperature of the wetlands has risen by 48.39%. Obviously, the development of the Puxiazhou wetlands to the exhibition center had resulted in the intensive land use change. The conversion of green and water areas to built-up lands had raised the land surface temperature and thus changed the thermal environment of the wetlands.

TI  - Bush Encroachment And Impacts On Grass Biomass In Senkelle Swayne’s Hartebeest Sanctuary, Ethiopia
JO  - Biodiversity
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess bush encroachment and its impact on herbaceous biomass in Senkelle Swayne’s Hartebeest Sanctuary. Data on the extent and trend of bush encroachment were collected using Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing techniques. A total of 50 plots were used for vegetation and grass biomass data collection. A nested plot design was used to collect woody species with diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥ 10 cm, dbh > 2 cm and < 10 cm and dbh ≤ 2 cm. Within each 20 m × 50 m plot, five subplots, each 0.5 m × 0.5 m, were used to gather grass biomass data. Grass biomass was determined in the laboratory by oven drying at 65–70°C for 48 h. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Analysis of satellite data was done by preprocessing satellite images and enumerating a change matrix. The results showed that: (i) total area covered by grassland declined by 9.8% while the total area covered by bushland increased by 21.4% over the past 30 years; (ii)seven woody species belonging to four families were recorded in the encroached area; (iii) there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in grass biomass between encroached and non-encroached strata; and (iv) the abundance of tree/shrub species and grass biomass were negatively correlated. Key policy insights There is an urgent requirement to implement projects that focus on bush clearance and the rehabilitation of grasslands appropriate for relevant foraging species–which could increase forage quality and quantity in protected areas. There is a need to develop and implement systems to determine the carrying capacity of the Swayne’s Hartebeest in the Senkelle Swayne’s Hartebeest Sanctuary to minimize negative impacts of overgrazing and ensure conservation of the species. Conflicting interests of local communities on the grazing land call for continuous awareness of the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services in these protected areas. © 2020 Biodiversity Conservancy International.

TI  - A Macrophysiology Approach To Watershed Science And Management
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Freshwaters are among the most imperiled ecosystems on the planet such that much effort is expended on environmental monitoring to support the management of these systems. Many traditional monitoring efforts focus on abiotic characterization of water quantity or quality and/or indices of biotic integrity that focus on higher scale population or community level metrics such as abundance or diversity. However, these indicators may take time to manifest in degraded systems and delay the identification and restoration of these systems. Physiological indicators manifest rapidly and portend oncoming changes in populations that can hasten restoration and facilitate preventative medicine for degraded habitats. Therefore, assessing freshwater ecosystem integrity using physiological indicators of health is a promising tool to improve freshwater monitoring and restoration. Here, we discuss the value of using comparative, longitudinal physiological data collected at a broad spatial (i.e. watershed) scale (i.e. macrophysiology) as a tool for monitoring aquatic ecosystem health within and among local watersheds to develop timely and effective management plans. There are emerging tools and techniques available for rapid, cost-effective, and non-lethal physiological sampling and we discuss how these can be integrated into management using fish as sentinel indicators in freshwater. Although many examples of this approach are relatively recent, we foresee increasing use of macrophysiology in monitoring, and advocate for the development of more standard tools for consistent and reliable assessment.

TI  - Pointnet++ Transfer Learning For Tree Extraction From Mobile Lidar Point Clouds
JO  - ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
AB  - Trees are an essential part of the natural and urban environment due to providing crucial benefits such as increasing air quality and wildlife habitats. Therefore, various remote sensing and photogrammetry technologies, including Mobile Laser Scanner (MLS), have been recently introduced for precise 3D tree mapping and modeling. The MLS provides densely 3D LiDAR point clouds from the surrounding, which results in measuring applicable information of trees like stem diameter or elevation. In this paper, a transfer learning procedure on the PointNet++ has been proposed for tree extraction. Initially, two steps of converting the MLS point clouds into same-length smaller sections and eliminating ground points have been conducted to overcome the massive volume of MLS data. The algorithm was tested on four LiDAR datasets ranging from challengeable urban environments containing multiple objects like tall buildings to railway surroundings. F1-Score accuracy was gained at around 93% and 98%, which showed the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Noticeably, the algorithms also measured geometrical information of extracted trees such as 2D coordinate space, height, stem diameter, and 3D boundary tree locations. © Author(s) 2023.

TI  - Study On The Compactness Assessment Model Of Urban Spatial Form
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica
AB  - The dramatic changes of China's urban spatial form have brought many problems in economic, social and urban construction. These changes also put the urban environment under enormous pressure, which was so fragile that forced urban sustainable development into serious challenge. To understand the progress and mechanism of urban landscape pattern changes, building appropriate quantitative assessment model for urban spatial form is significance for not only promoting China's sustainable urban development, but also achieving the goal of rational use and protection of regional eco- environment, which were the urgent needs of urban development in China. Based on Thinh et al. 's urban compactness degree derived from the law of universal gravitation, we built a new quantitative model, the Normalized Compactness Index (NCI), to assess urban spatial form, in which the round-shape city was supposed to achieve the highest compact degree giving the same urban size. NCI was obtained by dividing Thinh et al. 's original compactness by the maximum compactness that was defined for a round-shape city, which served as a standard unit of measurement to standardized the calculation results and eliminate the impact of urban size on compactness, and thus facilitated comparative analysis between different cities or the same city among different periods. We selected two periods (2002 and 2007) for empirical analysis in Xiamen City, using Landsat ETM + and Landsat TM remote sensing images as data sources. The whole area of city was divided into construction land and non-construction land. Construction land included building (residential, commercial, service and public facilitiy), mining, traffic and other land use types; non-construction land contained water body, wetland, woodland, farmland, bare land, etc. The results showed that: on the one hand, all of Xiamen's compact degrees of urban construction land in different spatial scalesincreased from 2002 to 2007; on the other hand, with the spatial scale increased, the values of NCI in two periods showed similar trend which was quick down first and slow steady followed. Therefore, we recommend that the model-scale analysis was necessary when using NCI for the comparative analysis between different cities or different periods in the same city. The significance of building compact city was reflected in relieving resource scarcity (such as land and energy), and overall sustainable development demands in China. The lower city's compact degree, the more fragmentized the urban space layout is, the higher costs and lower efficiency of population movements, economic activities and social intercourses within the city. However, more "round-shape" for urban spatial distribution presented urban population, industry, transportation, facilities and capitals are denser, cost is lower and efficiency of traffic and resource use are higher. Meanwhile, compact city could make it more concentrated for industries as well as flows of population, goods and information. Therefore, from macro level, the theory of compact city may guide urban development. NCI provided a new technical indicator for the quantitative assessment of urban spatial form. There is an urgent need to strengthen the empirical study of compact city, plan compact development route, and optimize regional spatial structure according to different geographical characteristics.

TI  - Cash For Carbon: A Randomized Trial Of Payments For Ecosystem Services To Reduce Deforestation
JO  - Science
AB  - We evaluated a program of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forestowning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The program was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the program for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this program benefit is 2.4 times as large as the program costs. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - A New Generation Of Tabs Ii Buoy For The Texas Automated Buoy System
JO  - Proceedings of MTS/IEEE OCEANS, 2005
AB  - The year 2005 marks the tenth anniversary of the Texas Automated Buoy System (TABS). The buoy network was developed for the Texas General Lands Office (TGLO) in support of oil spill modeling, mitigation and response in the Gulf of Mexico. The government of Texas, and in particular the TGLO have supported the TABS program since its inception in 1995 at seven locations in the Gulf of Mexico. The program currently has nine locations with the two additional sites receiving support through a joint industry project supported by a consortium of oil companies operating in the Flower Garden Banks region of the gulf. The initial buoy systems were developed by the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG) of Texas A&M University (TAMU) with the Woods Hole Group (WHG) of Falmouth, MA to measure and report near real time surface currents through cellular and satellite telemetry. Since the initial development in 1995, the buoy systems have evolved to include additional sensors such as ADCP's, CTD's, optical sensors, meteorological sensors, GPS, various means of telemetry and most recently, seafloor mounted sensors. In early 2003, GERG began to explore the means by which the TABS network could accommodate additional sensors to expand and enhance the data capability and data value to the end users, increase reliability, provide a faster turn around time during routine servicing and provide modularity in terms of both hardware and software. Because the TABS buoys are a spar design with limited power and space, choice of the right controller was critical. The TABS controller hardware was upgraded from a Motorola 68332 processor based system, to a more powerful PC104 computer system operating at 100 MHz, with 12 serial ports, 16 analog ports, 24 digital I/O's, 2 USB ports and fast Ethernet. The computer and peripherals operate at approximately 3 watts on a 12 volt supply making it suitable for long term deployments with a solar charging system. The CPU runs on a Linux operating system with high level software written Perl and modular sensor support written in C. The new buoys offer much greater flexibility in terms of the type and quantity of sensors the buoy can support, overall processing speed and capability, internal diagnostic capability, as well as the ability to safely handle remote software upgrades without danger of catastrophic failure if the upgrade is corrupted through telemetry. In February 2005 the first of the new generation buoys was deployed off of San Louis Pass located south west of Galveston, Texas. During this deployment new systems and sensors were tested including the ability of a TABS buoy to acoustically collect processed wave data from a bottom mounted wave gauge ADCP. The recent addition of wave capability to the TABS network enhances the data currently available to the end users of the TABS observing network.

TI  - The Rights Of Foreign Investors Over Land According To Investment Protection Treaties: A View From Latin America
JO  - ACDI Anuario Colombiano de Derecho Internacional
AB  - In the last ten years foreign investment in agriculture has increased notably in Latin America. Foreign investors, as much private as state, are interested on agricultural production, either for an expected benefit, or to assure the food supply. This increase in investment can be positive for the countries of the region. Nevertheless, in order to carry out this determination it is necessary to understand, among other things, the legal effects of these investment flows. This work maintains that the property rights acquired by foreign investors over the land and their agricultural undertakings may be different from the rights of national investors. This is because of foreign investment protection treaties. The strengthening of the rights of foreign investors affects the relationship between these investors and the receiving state. This article analyzes the effects of the rights of foreign investors in ration to five categories of state initiatives. Specifically, they are 1) the right to export production or the cost of exportation in the face of commercial and taxation measures; the right to continue a project in the face of changes within the regulatory paradigm; 3) the right to continue a project in the face of political change or new social preferences; 4) the right to receive better compensation in the face of agricultural reforms or programmes of historical reparation; 5) the right to maintain the business plan in the face of a food crisis. © 2016, Universidad del Rosario.

TI  - Mapping Root Zone Soil Moisture Using Remotely Sensed Optical Imagery
JO  - Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering
AB  - Field-based soil moisture measurements are cumbersome. Remote sensing techniques based on active or passive microwave data have limitations. This paper presents and validates a new method based on land surface energy balances using remotely sensed optical data (including thermal infrared), which allows field and landscape-scale mapping of soil moisture depth-averaged through the root zone of existing vegetation. Root zone depth can be variable when crops are emerging. The pixel-wise "evaporative fraction" (ratio of latent heat flux to net available energy) is related to volumetric soil moisture through a standard regression curve that is independent of soil and vegetation type. Validation with measured root zone soil moisture in cropped soils in Mexico and Pakistan has a root mean square error of 0.05 cm3 cm-3: the error is less than 0.07 cm3 cm-3 in 90% of cases. Consequently, soil moisture data should be presented in class intervals of 0.05 cm3 cm-3. The utility of this method is demonstrated at the field scale using multitemporal thematic mapper imagery for irrigated areas near Cortazar in Mexico, and for river basin-scale water resources distribution in Pakistan. The potential limitation is the presence of clouds and the time lag between consecutive images with field-scale resolution. With the falling price of optical satellite imagery, this technique should gain wider acceptance with river basin planners, watershed managers, and irrigation and drainage engineers.

TI  - Multisensor Fusion
AB  - Applications involving remotely-sensed images arouse the interest of a large user community. The paper focuses on the fusion of multisensor images available from satellite onboard sensors and in particular on image processing. The physico-diversity of image dimensions allows combination as an aid to extracting relevant information. Such dimensions as spatial, spectral, temporal, angular or polarimetric can be cleverly merged. Data assimilation models corresponding to either a confrontation model or an incorporation model are described within three architectures: centralised, de-centralised and mixed. The quality of the result depends on the assessment of several sources of error. Synergism as a function of data interaction and errors management is discussed within these architectures. Certain image dimensions requisite to improve data fusion techniques are nowadays taken into account as from the conception of a sensor programme. In conclusion, the fusion of data as an aid to define new value-added products is presented, which allows us to consider this technique as being one of the future trends in remote sensing.

TI  - Increased Water Use Efficiency In China And Its Drivers During 2000-2016
JO  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), the carbon uptake per unit of water consumption, is a critical indicator of the coupling between water and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the spatiotemporal changes in WUE and its drivers is vital for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Herein, we used a remote sensing-driven analytical model to estimate spatiotemporal variations of WUE in China during 2000-2016 and quantified its key drivers. The simulated WUE matched well with the eddy covariance observations across different ecosystems in China, with coefficients of determination of 0.86 and 0.81. The annual WUE increased significantly at a rate of 0.021 g C mm(-1) H2O y(-1) (P < 0.01), with the mean value of 1.62 g C mm(-1) H2O during 2000-2016. Analyses based on a factorial experiment (FE) and the sensitivity method (SE) showed that the increased leaf area index was the largest contributor to the increase in WUE, with contributions of 50.1\% and 42.8\% determined via FE and SE, respectively. CO2 enrichment was the second largest contributor (FE: 20.7\% and SE: 31.4\%), followed by the decrease in the vapor pressure deficit (FE: 15.4\% and SE: 13.4\%). The increased ratio of water loss by canopy interaction had a negative impact on WUE due to the increased non-productive water loss. Although these attributions had some inherent uncertainties, the results highlighted that the significant greening in China, which was mainly caused by human land-use management, and increased CO2 concentrations significantly promoted WUE during the recent 17 years.

TI  - Statistical Modeling Of Extreme Precipitation With Trmm Data
JO  - Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology
AB  - This paper improves upon an existing extreme precipitation monitoring system that is based on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) daily product (3B42) using new statistical models. The proposed system utilizes a regional modeling approach in which data from similar locations are pooled to increase the quality of the resulting model parameter estimates to compensate for the short data record. The regional analysis is divided into two stages. First, the region defined by the TRMM measurements is partitioned into approximately 28 000 nonoverlapping clusters using a recursive k-means clustering scheme. Next, a statistical model is used characterize the extreme precipitation events occurring in each cluster. Instead of applying the block maxima approach used in the existing system, in which the generalized extreme value probability distribution is fit to the annual precipitation maxima at each site separately, the present work adopts the peak-over-threshold method of classifying points as extreme if they exceed a prespecified threshold. Theoretical considerations motivate using the point process framework for modeling extremes. The fitted parameters are used to estimate trends and to construct simple and intuitive average recurrence interval (ARI) maps that reveal how rare a particular precipitation event is. This information could be used by policy makers for disaster monitoring and prevention. The new method eliminates much of the noise that was produced by the existing models because of a short data record, producing more reasonable ARI maps when compared with NOAA's long-term Climate Prediction Center ground-based observations. Furthermore, the proposed method can be applied to other extreme climate records. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.

TI  - Analysis On The Spatial Distribution Variation Characteristic Of Urban Heat Environmental Quality And Its Mechanism - A Case Study Of Hangzhou City
JO  - Chinese Geographical Science
AB  - Urban heat environmental quality (UHEQ) is affected by the interacting of weather condition and underlying surface framework of urban area. In the last two decades, many researchers from domestic and overseas have studied many problems at the aspect of urban heat environment such as urban heat islands, urban air temperature and their relation with urban land cover, city population, air pollution etc. In the recent years, Hangzhou, acting as a center city of Zhejiang Province in China, its urbanization quantum and quantity have both changed greatly, in particular, representing as business affairs building, resident real property and all kinds of specialty market having arisen in built-up zone. Based on Landsat TM images data in 1991 and 1999, urban underlying surface temperature value and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated using image interpreting and supervised classification technique by remote sensing software ERDAS image 8.4. The relation model between urban underlying surface temperature (UUST) and urban air temperature was setup according to the certain correlation pattern. Reference to the relational standard of assessing human comfort and other meteorology data of Hangzhou City in summer, the spatial distribution characteristic and the spatial variation degree of human comfort of heat environmental quality are estimated and mapped on a middle scale, that is, in six districts of Hangzhou City. Then the paper reveals the main characteristic of spatial variation from 1991 to 1999. Lastly, the change mechanism is analyzed and discussed from the viewpoint of city planning, construction and environmental protection.

TI  - Acquisition Of Earth Science Remote Sensing Observations From Commercial Sources: Lessons Learned From The Space Imaging Ikonos Example
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Over the last decade, NASA and other federal agencies have been increasingly encouraged to explore commercial sources of land remote sensing data rather than pursuing government-funded sources of these measurements (prior to U.S. Commercial Executive, 2003. U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. White House, Washington, DC). The science and applications users have been skeptical of this move to commercial sources of observations both because of uncertainty over the capabilities of the private sector and the unsatisfactory outcomes of previous efforts to commercialize satellite-acquired land remote sensing observations. In an effort to more fully explore the potential of commercial remotely sensed land data sources, the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) implemented an experimental Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) that solicited bids from the private sector to meet ESE-user data needs. The SDP activity spanned nearly 5 years and supplied many US and international researchers with sources of land remote sensing observations that had not been previously available. The images from the Space Imaging IKONOS system provided a particularly good match to the current ESE missions such as Terra and Landsat 7 and therefore serve as focal point in this analysis. Throughout the SDP process, there have been many lessons learned concerning interactions between US industry, government agencies and the science user community. The specifies of the Space Imaging IKONOS experience under the NASA SDP are most valuable with respect to possible future uses of commercial vendors to supply NASA ESE user needs for space-acquired land observations. Areas where valuable lessons were learned included the technical, scientific, proprietary and management aspects of the interactions. As this activity has evolved, user confidence in the technical and scientific qualities of the IKONOS measurements has increased substantially. There are still areas where further progress could be achieved, with respect to proprietary and management aspects of scientific commercial data buys. To date, the NASA scientific and applications users who have examined the IKONOS imagery have found the data to be of high quality, providing substantial value to their specific pursuits. They have found that the novel attributes of IKONOS, particularly in the spatiotemporal domain have introduced new analysis challenges not previously experienced with EOS sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. The technical qualities of the observations have been substantially improved during the SDP activity as a result of independent validation and verification by the Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) of the IKONOS observations. The experience gained from the Space Imaging IKONOS SDP activity, suggests that US private sector is technically capable of meeting the needs of NASA ESE science and application users. The future success of such interactions between industry, government and users appears to be far more dependent on the organizational and legal aspects of such arrangements than technical capabilities of the data providers.

TI  - Reconstructing Monthly Ecv Global Soil Moisture With An Improved Spatial Resolution
JO  - Water Resources Management
AB  - Remote sensing techniques have provided global covered soil moisture at high temporal resolution, however, the coarse spatial resolution and the data gaps have greatly reduced their potential values in large numbers of practical and regional applications. This study proposed a two-steps reconstruction approach for reconstructing satellite-based soil moisture products (ECV) at an improved spatial resolution. The reconstruction model implemented the Random Forests (RF) regression algorithm to simulate the relationships between soil moisture and environmental variables, and takes advantages of the high spatial resolution of optical remote sensing products: the data gaps of ECV soil moisture products were firstly filled by the estimation model trained using available pixels of the ECV products and corresponding environmental variables; then a spatial downscaling was carried out to the gap-filled ECV products to obtain the reconstructed soil moisture with fine spatial resolution (0.05°). As a result, the reconstructed soil moisture well fill the data gaps of the original ECV products and nicely reproduced the original soil moisture values (R2 > 0.98). The spatial resolution and variation details of the soil moisture products were also improved significantly. Validation results indicated that the reconstructed soil moisture showed comparable good performance (average R2 = 0.66) as the original ECV products (average R2 = 0.65) and nicely reflect the temporal behavior of ground-based measurements. As a result, the reconstructed soil moisture well filled the data gaps and greatly improved the spatial resolution of ECV products. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Supporting Rehabilitation Training Of Copd Patients Through Multivariate Sensor-Based Monitoring And Autonomous Control Using A Bayesian Network: Prototype And Results Of A Feasibility Study
JO  - Informatics for Health and Social Care
AB  - Repeated endurance training supervised by an expert is one of the most effective rehabilitation methods for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to improve physical function. Monitoring of vital signs in combination with an automatic intelligent training control and emergency detection facilitates supervised training without the physical presence of an expert as well as training optimisation through individualisation. The aim of this study is the development of a suitable analysis and control method for this purpose. Healthy volunteers and patients with COPD were equipped with body sensors during ergometer training to enable measuring their vital signs continuously. Depending on these values, the exercise load of the ergometer was controlled automatically using a Bayesian network. The network, trained with expert knowledge and training data, is embedded in our system by using Java application programming interface. Extensive tests in a laboratory setting have proved safe usage of our prototype. In a case study, evaluation during training sessions with patients with COPD took place. Due to the automatic control the patients' vital signs ranged inside the predefined optimal thresholds for at least 95 of the time. Furthermore, our results suggest an increase of the training efficiency compared with the conventional method (constant exercise load). © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

TI  - The Economic Benefits Of Rainwater-Runoff Reduction By Urban Green Spaces: A Case Study In Beijing, China
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - Urbanization involves the replacement of vegetated surfaces with impervious built surfaces, and it often results in an increase in the rate and volume of rainwater surface runoff. Urban green spaces play a positive role in rainwater-runoff reduction. However, few studies have explored the benefits of rainwater-runoff reduction by urban green spaces. Based on inventory data of urban green spaces in Beijing, the paper evaluated the economic benefits of rainwater-runoff reduction by urban green spaces, using the rainwater-runoff-coefficient method as well as the economic valuation methods. The results showed that, 2494 cubic meters of potential runoff was reduced per hectare of green area and a total volume of 154 million cubic meters rainwater was stored in these urban green spaces, which almost corresponds to the annual water needs of the urban ecological landscape in Beijing. The total economic benefit was 1.34 billion RMB in 2009 (RMB: Chinese currency, US$1 = RMB6.83), which is equivalent to three-quarters of the maintenance cost of Beijing's green spaces; the value of rainwater-runoff reduction was 21.77 thousand RMB per hectare. In addition, the benefits in different districts and counties were ranked in the same order as urban green areas, and the average benefits per hectare of green space showed different trends, which may be related to the impervious surface index in different regions. This research will contribute to an understanding of the role that Beijing's green spaces play in rainwater regulation and in the creation and scientific management of urban green spaces. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Analysis Of Regional Economic Development Based On Remote Sensing Images
AB  - As the carrier of economic activities, land resource is an indispensable production factor of economic development. Economic growth leads to increased demand for land and changes in land utilization form. Therefore, changes in land use and land cover can reflect regional economic development situations to some extent. This paper proposed a method to predict regional economic situations based on remote sensing images, in which land use and land cover data is extracted by remote sensing images classification. Taking Zhoushan City as study area, the land use and land cover information from 2000 to 2015 was obtained through Landsat satellite images and then was used to construct regional economic development prediction models for 7 economic indexes. The results showed that the prediction errors of gross domestic product, products of primary industry, products of secondary industry, products of tertiary industry, fixed assets investment, gross output value of fisheries, and total tourist income are 7.8\%, 9.11\%, 6.93\%, 7.74\%, 15.31\%, 7.29\%, 11.76\%, respectively.

TI  - Hurricane-Faster R-Cnn-Js: Hurricane Detection With Faster R-Cnn Using Artificial Jellyfish Search (Js) Optimizer
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
AB  - A hurricane is a type of storm called tropical cyclone (TC) and is likely to lead to severe storms and heavy rains. An early detection of hurricanes using satellite images can alarm people about upcoming disasters and thus minimize any casualties and material losses. Faster R-CNN is one of the most popular and recent object detection approaches. In the present study, AlexNet hyperparameters, which is a CNN model used as a feature extractor in Faster R-CNN, were optimized using artificial Jellyfish Search (JS), which is a recent algorithm, in order to propose a Faster R-CNN with a higher performance. The proposed approach is called Hurricane-Faster R-CNN-JS, since it is used as an early hurricane detection approach on satellite images before these hurricanes reach the land. The results of the present study demonstrated that hyperparameter optimization increased the detection performance of the proposed approach by 10% compared to AlexNet without optimized hyperparameters. As feature extractors of Faster R-CNN, the present study benefited from various architectures such as MobileNet-V2, GoogLeNet, AlexNet, ResNet 18, ResNet 50, VGG-16 and VGG-19 without any optimized hyperparameters to compare them with the proposed approach. It was observed that Average Precision (AP) of Hurricane-Faster R-CNN-JS was 97.39%, which was a remarkably higher AP level compared to other approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Digital Therapeutics: Emerging New Therapy For Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
JO  - Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology
AB  - The increased prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) worldwide is particularly worrisome, as no medication has been approved to treat the disease. Lifestyle modifications aimed at promoting weight loss and weight maintenance remain the current first-line treatment for NAFLD. However, due to the lack of standard and scientific guidance and out-of-hospital supervision, long-term outcomes of lifestyle interventions for patients with NAFLD are often unsatisfactory. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic aggravated this dilemma. At the same time, digital therapeutics (DTx) are expected to be a new method for the convenient management and treatment of patients with NAFLD and are attracting a great deal of attention. DTx, which provide evidence-based medicine through software programs for remote intervention in preventing, treating, or managing diseases, overcome the drawbacks of traditional treatment. The efficacy of the approach has already been demonstrated for some chronic diseases, but DTx have not been fully developed for NAFLD. This study reviews the concepts, clinical value, and practical applications related to DTx, with an emphasis on recommendations based on unmet needs for NAFLD. A better understanding of the current state will help clinicians and researchers develop high-quality, standardized, and efficient DTx products, with the aim of optimizing the prognosis of patients with NAFLD. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Land Reclamation And Risk Assessment In The Coastal Zone Of China From 2000 To 2010
JO  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Monitoring and assessing of land reclamation are essential components of sustainable coastal management. In this study, satellite remote sensing data were used in combination with ground investigations to systematically obtain land reclamation data for the coastal zone of China from 2000-2010. Then, the spatiotemporal variation in land reclamation and morphology of the coastal zone was analyzed. Furthermore, a spatially explicit habitat risk assessment (HRA) model from the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST 3.0) suite of tools was adopted to evaluate the risk posed by land reclamation to key coastal habitats over these ten years. Our results show that (1) the overall land reclamation intensity was higher in the north and lower in the south. At the Sea Region level, both the sea-filling area and tidal flat reclamation area in the Bohai Sea were higher than those of the other three sea regions. At the province level, Hebei, Jiangsu and Tianjin provinces were the top three in sea-filling reclamation, while Liaoning, Jiangsu and Shandong exhibited the greatest increases in tidal flat reclamation; (2) 31.2\% of land reclamation happened in the natural coastal zone, reducing natural coastlines from 54.6\% to 44.1\% between 2000 and 2010; (3) land reclamation posed a great risk to important coastal habitats. Half of the tidal flat and 5\% of the mangrove habitats experienced a high risk from tidal flat reclamation and sea filling, while 43.1\% of saline meadows were at high risk, mainly from agricultural development and industrial construction. We argue that regional development strategies played important roles in stimulating land reclamation from 2000-2010. Considering multiple social and ecological functions of the coastal zone, trade-offs between land reclamation and ecosystem conservation should be recognized. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - <I>Prosopis Juliflora</I> Management And Grassland Restoration In Baringo County, Kenya: Opportunities For Soil Carbon Sequestration And Local Livelihoods
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Climate change, land degradation and invasive alien species (IAS) threaten grassland ecosystems worldwide. IAS clearing and grassland restoration would help to reduce the negative effects of IAS, restore the original vegetation cover and sustain livelihoods while contributing to climate change mitigation, but uncertain financial benefits to local stakeholders hamper such efforts. This study assessed where and when net financial benefit could be realized from Prosopis juliflora management and subsequent grassland restoration by combining ecological, social and financial information. Impacts of Prosopis invasion and grassland degradation on soil organic carbon (SOC) in nine sublocations in Baringo County, Kenya, were evaluated. Then the financial impacts of Prosopis removal and grassland restoration in the area were calculated and spatially explicit management scenarios for each sublocation modelled, combining geographical information derived from satellite images taken in different years of the invasion with SOC data and socio-economic data collected in the sublocations. The expanding Prosopis distribution and density since 1995 have increased cumulated SOC storage on former bare land or degraded grasslands. On former pristine or restored grasslands, however, Prosopis invasion has reduced total SOC storage. Prosopis removal and grassland restoration are predicted to yield financial benefits through charcoal made from removed trees, increased cattle numbers and carbon credits. However, a trade-off between increased SOC and net financial benefit was found. The predicted net SOC increase would contribute around one-tenth, at most, to the net financial benefit. The available budget, based on Baringo households' average willingness to pay, would enable removal, on average, of one-fifth of Prosopis per sublocation in a single year. A larger area can be cleared if Prosopis is sparse than if it is dense. The analyses show that in some sublocations, households' annual investments could result in restoration of all former grassland areas. Synthesis and applications. This study shows how integrating and linking detailed ecological, social and financial geodata to develop accurate and realistic invasive alien species management scenarios can illustrate costs and benefits of management interventions in a spatial context. Such scenarios should be used more extensively to support land management decisions.

TI  - Landscape Pattern And Ecosystem Service Value Changes: Implications For Environmental Sustainability Planning For The Rapidly Urbanizing Summer Capital Of The Philippines
JO  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - This study analyzes the dynamics of the socio-ecological system of Baguio City, the summer capital of the Philippines, in order to derive meaningful information for use in planning its sustainable development. Remote sensing data and geographic information systems techniques, in conjunction with spatial metrics and socio-economic information, were used to facilitate the analysis. The spatial and socio-economic components of Baguio's rapid urbanization over the past 21 years (1988-2009) were the major factors that contributed to dramatic changes in the setting's natural landscape, as indicated by an almost threefold increase in its built-up area, at the expense of other land-use/land-cover classes. Its rapid growth has seen the city's population exceed its designed ceiling of 25,000 people by a factor of at least twelve. Such landscape changes and population growth have resulted in a substantial decrease in the overall annual ecosystem service value (ESV) of Baguio of approximately 60\%. The human-to-ESV ratio in the city has also decreased over this same period, from 1:31 (US\$/year) in 1988 to just 1:7 in 2009. Although Baguio has enjoyed economic, political and social prominence for more than a century, its rapid population growth and urban expansion are now exerting pressure on its natural landscape, jeopardizing the environmental sustainability of this highly valued hill station. This study offers important insights to all, but especially those in fast-urbanizing regions, as Baguio's case offers learning experience valuable for achieving more successful landscape and urban planning.

TI  - Enhancing Catch-And-Release Science With Biotelemetry
JO  - FISH AND FISHERIES
AB  - Catch-and-release (C\&R) angling is widely practised by anglers and is a common fisheries management strategy or is a by-product of harvest regulations. Accordingly, there is a growing body of research that examines not only the mortality associated with C\&R, but also the sublethal physiological and behavioural consequences. Biotelemetry offers a powerful means of remotely monitoring the behaviour, physiology and mortality of fish caught and released in their natural environment, but we contend that its usefulness is still underappreciated by scholars and managers. In this study, we review the applications of biotelemetry in C\&R science, identify novel research directions, opportunities and challenges. There are now about 250 C\&R studies but only one quarter of these utilize biotelemetry. In fact, almost all of the C\&R studies that have used biotelemetry have been conducted within the last decade. We found that the majority of C\&R telemetry studies used either radio or acoustic telemetry, while comparatively few studies have used satellite technologies. Most C\&R biotelemetry studies have been used to assess mortality rates, behavioural impairments or to evaluate the effects of displacement on fish. A small fraction of studies (< 8\%) have used physiological sensors despite the fact that these tools are highly applicable to understanding the multiple sublethal consequences of C\&R and are useful for providing mechanistic insights into endpoints such as death. We conclude that C\&R science has the potential to benefit greatly from biotelemetry technology, particularly with respect to providing more robust short-term and delayed mortality estimates and adopting a more integrative and comparative approach to understanding the lethal and sublethal impacts of C\&R. However, there are still a number of challenges including (i) the need for appropriate controls and methodological approaches, (ii) the need for accounting for tagging and handling stress and mortality, and (iii) the need for certainty in assessing mortality. However, the benefits associated with C\&R biotelemetry outweigh its disadvantages and limitations and thereby offer C\&R researchers a suite of new tools to enhance fisheries management and conservation.

AB  - This work analyzes the changes in land use from 2003 to 2011 in a peripheral sector of 79, 62 hectares located at the Southern hilly area of Tandil city and its connection with groundwater quality and availability. The comparison and mapping of satellite images of the study area showed changes in land use from non-defined land uses and crop lands to tourist-commercial and residential utilization. However, this sector does not have drinking water and sewer systems. People use domiciliary boreholes to exploit phreatic aquifer for human and recreational consumption and they dispose their effluents in cesspits. Several problems related to groundwater use were found such as borehole drying, need to make them deeper, water quality disturbances, groundwater shortage in summer mainly for swimming pools, clogged cesspits due to extreme rains. Phreatic levels were measured and groundwater samples were taken in 2008 and 2011 to determine electrical conductivity (EC) and nitrate levels. Groundwater flew to the north and phreatic levels decreased in 2011. EC varied between 480 and 1400 mu S.cm(-1), showing local contamination in the most populated area. Nitrates showed the same pattern varying from 6 to 85 mg.L-1, including a site with more than 200 mg.L-1. The sector with the highest values is located downstream from groundwater flow. These alterations are mainly caused by local disposition of domiciliary effluents generating a half-closed cycle of groundwater disposition, transport and exploitation. The lack of both landuse planning from an environmental perspective and sanitary services together with recharge zone urbanization poses a risk to groundwater quality and availability as well as to human health.

TI  - Mangroves And Seagrasses
JO  - Blue Economy: An Ocean Science Perspective
AB  - Mangroves and seagrass contribute to people’s quality of life, taking an important place in the Blue Economy context. Activities such as fishing contribute to the national economies of many developing nations. Carbon sequestration in these systems is considered among the most effective among ecosystem types-even including terrestrial systems-and helps mitigate climate change impacts. Nature-based tourism activities, including in mangrove and seagrass systems, add to the conservation values of these systems, engaging both stakeholders and local commu-nities and generating income through these activities. Biotechnology research and new studies continually reveal the potential of these blue systems for discovery of marine natural products that could be important for medicine, cosmetics, and other products. Despite their importance and potential, mangrove and seagrass systems are under-considered by decision-makers as vulnerable environments, faced by several threats, which has led to decreased areas of these systems. For our future and better exploration of their potential in the blue economy context, mapping Blue Carbon Ecosystems, implementation of restoration programs, and incorporating the ecosystem services they provide into financial valuation frameworks need to be urgent priorities all over the world, especially in developing countries. © The Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries (NAM SandT Centre) 2022.

TI  - Modelling Leaf Chlorophyll Content In Coffee (Coffea Arabica) Plantations Using Sentinel 2 Msi Data
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - Coffee leaf chlorophyll (Chl) is an important proxy for coffee plant photosynthetic rates, nitrogen content, leaf health and yield potential. Whereas the recently launched Sentinel 2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) data has great potential for plant condition assessment, the value of its spectral settings at variable spatial resolutions in relation to crop canopy cover on Chl content prediction remains largely unexplored. In this study, we apply an empirical model to estimate coffee leaf Chl with Sentinel 2 MSI data. Results showed that coffee biophysical parameters (height and canopy cover) are significantly influenced by stand age while plant water concentration and total Chl are age invariant. Results further showed that the best modelling results (R2=0.69, RMSE=64.4) were achieved when all the bands at 10m spatial resolution with all data were used. We concluded that Sentinel 2 MSI is a valuable dataset for predicting coffee leaf Chl, however, based on our findings, we suggest that finer spatial resolutions of 10m on mature coffee stands should be adopted for better prediction results. . © 2018 IEEE

TI  - Nasa's Laser Risk Reduction Program: A Risk Reduction Approach For Technology Development
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - The benefits of Earth Science (ES) laser instrumentation have been proven by decades of earth-science observations. Lasers allow remote sensing of earth-system variables such as sea elevation, atmospheric composition, wind profiles, cloud cover, ice mass, and vegetation canopy. Further, orbiting platforms provide a unique vantage point that allows laser measurements on a global scale. NASA implemented the Laser Risk Reduction Program (LRRP) to identify and address capability-gap areas where new devices or processes could yield high-reliability mission-ready parts, and to develop components needed to advance the state-of-the-art of laser-based instrumentation. This paper discusses LRRP's approach and the evolution of the program's developments from inception to their planned infusion into NASA's missions. It is the first part of a three-paper presentation (Program goals and organization; 1μ, developments and results at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC); and 2μ developments and results at Langley Research Center (LaRC)) that summarizes LRRP's goals, formulation approach, management organization, and final results. © 2010 IEEE.

JO  - SPACE APPLI 2008 - Space Applications Days
AB  - Nowadays, following the proliferation on the web of many geoinformation data with the emergence of GoogleMap, VirtualEarth and other client and data providers, some important problem of accessibility and exploitation have appeared due to the heavy of those data flux and moreover to the heterogeneous standard for metadata description. Some major efforts are done by the Open Geospatial Consortium®, a non-profit, international, voluntary consensus standards organization, in order to lead the development of standards for geospatial and location based services. One of the most recognized and used standard for access to geospatial data is the OGC Web Map Service (WMS). A WMS produces dynamically maps of spatially referenced data from geographic information. Through this standard, any client can access maps and combine (overlay them like clear acetate sheets) them from one or more servers. Since 2006, EADS Astrium is an OGC's Technical Committee Member, which gives us the opportunity to submit drafted OGC standards that enable interoperability of geospatial data and services. EADS Astrium participates to different technical and thematic working group and leads a European OGC pilot project federating Earth Observation Space resources. In the framework of internal R&D activities, EADS Astrium is developing a Meta Earth Information environment (MeTiS) in order to demonstrate the advantages of interoperability standards and new Web 2.0 technologies. Web 2.0 is the business revolution of these last years due to the Internet transition towards a collaborative platform. MeTiS is a Mash-Up solution based on Web2.0 technologies (AJAX, CSS...) that allows users to continue interacting with the MMI in real time despite the heavy transfer of geospatial data. Using image streaming capabilities, users can navigate and zoom in map and geospatial data with the maximum of agility achievable according to the network bandwidth. MeTiS is a virtual earth information environment integrating both benefits of Web 2.0 wave technologies together with OGC interoperability standards (WMS). MeTiS offers to end user an ergonomic and user friendly interface for geospatial data discovery and aggregation. Dedicated to users' needs for environmental monitoring purpose, MeTiS manages and records user-context allowing persistent remote access to various distributed data sources. It provides access to remote interoperable servers such as background "streaming" web map APIs like Googlemap, YahooMap, Windows Live Local, etc... and environmental WMS offering access to data and value added products at different scales relevant to different user communities. MeTiS offers many functional and operational capabilities such as navigation into a web on-line "Google Map Like" application, subscription to a certain number of WMS and dynamically aggregates the related layers, definition and management of different thematic working environments and saving/restoring users' context for further connections.

TI  - Space Education And Awareness In South Africa-Programmes, Initiatives, Achievements, Challenges & Issues
JO  - 15th International Conference on Space Operations, 2018
AB  - South Africa’s involvement in the Space Science started at the dawn of the “Space Age”. Before this, South Africa had been involved in Astronomy since 1820, when the first permanent astronomical observatory (and scientific institution) in the southern hemisphere was completed at the Cape of Good Hope. Despite this rich history, South Africa has unfortunately, for various reasons, not been able to fully exploit the benefits of space technology and its applications to meet the challenges-it faces. One reason in particular is lack of awareness and understanding by planners, decision-makers and users about the potential benefits of space technology in planning and implementation of socio-economic development plans. In recent years, South Africa has made the development and cultivation of a domestic space industry a priority, citing the critical roles that space science, technology and innovation play in economic growth and socio-economic development. However, to ensure a long-term viable space programme and a growing space industry, it is imperative that South Africa builds the necessary capacity to support such an industry-hence the need to create awareness and an appreciation for STEM-based careers at all levels of society which, for our school-going population, is likely to translate into an increase in the uptake and appreciation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In South Africa, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) plays a leading role in the implementation of space science and technology activities. Current space-related projects include the Satellite Build Programme; Operation Phakisa and the CubeSats Development Programme. There are also a number of local programmes and initiatives to promote space education and awareness. These are initiated, supported and implemented by various organizations, from the DST and its agencies through to the private sector and industry, as well as non-governmental and nonprofit organizations. With regard to reaching out to schools, the DST conducts Space Weeks and other science festivals, as well as numerous initiatives by the local Radio Amateurs Clubs working with schools on High Altitute Ballooning projects. Nonetheless, it has been noted that although there is much effort and resources expended on STEM awareness, there is notable lack of its intended impact. The role of educators/teaching staff will therefore be addressed focusing on their contribution to the goals of such STEM programmes. This paper discusses the various Space-based STEM programmes that have been put in place to promote space education awareness and the contribution made by various role playes. Furthermore, this paper will showcase a concept for a new approach to Space Awareness activities, and its potential to drive STEM awareness programmes in the country. Lastly, this paper aims to recognize the achievements of South Africa in promoting space education and awareness in the country and the related issues and impediments to pursue these programs. The paper also emphasizes the importance of introducing space education programs in schools not only for the children but for the teachers in particular. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

TI  - Association Between Canine Malignant Lymphoma, Living In Industrial Areas, And Use Of Chemicals By Dog Owners
JO  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - A case-control study was carried out to determine whether residential exposure to environmental pollutants increased risk for canine lymphoma in pet dugs. One hundred one cases with cyctologically or histologically confirmed lymphoma diagnosed at a veterinary teaching hospital between the middle of 1996 and the middle of 1998 were examined. Controls were obtained by choosing twice the number of dogs without neoplastic disease. with overlapping distributions of province of residence, age, sex. and breed. Information regarding animal management. residence type, professional or hobby use of chemicals by owners, and treatment with herbicides or other pesticides in the area li frequently visited by the dogs was obtained with a multiple-choice questionnaire by telephone interview. Two variables were positively and independently associated with the disease. namely residency in industrial areas (odds ratio {[}OR]: = 8.5: 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]. 2.3-30.9) and use of chemicals by owners, specifically paints or solvents (OR = 4.6: 95\% CI. 1.7-12.6). A significantly lower value of the mean apr of disease onset was found in the group of dogs at risk in comparison with the group of all other dogs (6.1 +/- 0.4 years, n = 36 versus 7.5 +/- 0.4 years. n = 65, respectively; P = .008). Variables describing animal care and pesticide use were either not associated with the disease or were uninformative. We suggest that canine lymphoma may be considered a sentinel of potentially hazardous situations for humans, because of the relatively short latency between exposure and disease onset.

TI  - Effect Of Airborne Particulate Matter Of 2.5 μm Or Less On Preterm Birth: A National Birth Cohort Study In China
JO  - Environment International
AB  - Background: Most evidences regarding ambient PM2.5 or PM10 (particulate matter of median aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm or ≤10 μm) and preterm birth (PTB) come from western countries which has relatively low PM pollution exposure, and the results are still inconsistent. This study aims to examine whether exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 or PM10 was associated with PTB (<37 weeks) and near term birth (37–38 weeks). Method: We established a birth cohort with 1,280,524 singleton pregnancies who delivered from Dec 1st, 2013 to Nov 30th, 2014 and matched their home address to PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations which were predicted with machine learning methods based satellite remote sensing, meteorological and land use information. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the associations between PTB and exposure of PM2.5 or PM10, after controlling for individual level covariates. Results: Exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 during pregnancy increases the risk of PTB and near term birth [e.g., Hazard ratios: 1.09 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.10), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.08), 1.01 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.02), and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.10) for each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester and over the entire pregnancy, respectively]. The effects appeared to be stronger among women who come from rural areas, worked as farmers, were overweight before conception, whose mate was smoking during pregnancy, and conceived in autumn. Conclusion: This study provides clear evidence that exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 during pregnancy increases the risk of PTB and near term birth. Public policies regarding improvement of air quality would produce great health benefit by reducing the burden of preterm birth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - On The Potential Of Surfers To Monitor Environmental Indicators In The Coastal Zone
JO  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The social and economic benefits of the coastal zone make it one of the most treasured environments on our planet. Yet it is vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Coastal management aims to mitigate these pressures while augmenting the socio-economic benefits the coastal region has to offer. However, coastal management is challenged by inadequate sampling of key environmental indicators, partly due to issues relating to cost of data collection. Here, we investigate the use of recreational surfers as platforms to improve sampling coverage of environmental indicators in the coastal zone. We equipped a recreational surfer, based in the south west United Kingdom (UK), with a temperature sensor and Global Positioning System (GPS) device that they used when surfing for a period of one year (85 surfing sessions). The temperature sensor was used to derive estimates of sea-surface temperature (SST), an important environmental indicator, and the GPS device used to provide sample location and to extract information on surfer performance. SST data acquired by the surfer were compared with data from an oceanographic station in the south west UK and with satellite observations. Our results demonstrate: (i) high-quality SST data can be acquired by surfers using low cost sensors; and (ii) GPS data can provide information on surfing performance that may help motivate data collection by surfers. Using recent estimates of the UK surfing population, and frequency of surfer participation, we speculate around 40 million measurements on environmental indicators per year could be acquired at the UK coastline by surfers. This quantity of data is likely to enhance coastal monitoring and aid UK coastal management. Considering surfing is a world-wide sport, our results have global implications and the approach could be expanded to other popular marine recreational activities for coastal monitoring of environmental indicators.

TI  - Disaggregating Sdg-6 Water Stress Indicator At Different Spatial And Temporal Scales In Tunisia
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The recently adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) encompasses a specific goal for water (SDG-6). The target 6.4 deals with water scarcity and refers to two main indicators: water use efficiency and water stress (WS), monitored by the UN statistical services yearly at the country level. Yet, for more efficient development planning, indicators should also be provided with higher spatial and temporal resolutions. This study presents a data-driven method allowing to disaggregate the WS indicator at higher spatial and temporal resolution. We applied the method for the Medjerda catchment in Tunisia, known as being severely water-stressed. We disaggregated the WS indicator from the overall catchment to the administrative regional level at yearly and monthly scales. In order to overcome poorly documented irrigation water withdrawals, two approaches were adopted: 1) we used yearly governmental data at both catchment and regions scales; 2) we replaced governmental irrigation data by remote sensing-based irrigation estimation. First Order Uncertainty Analysis (FOUA) was performed to characterize the uncertainty associated with the assessment of WS. Results reveal that the WS at the scale of the catchment increases considerably in recent years, exceeding 50\% from 2005 and surpassing the 100\% threshold in 2015 and 2016 (102\%, 108\% respectively). The two adopted approaches result in similar WS trends. However, the second approach yields higher WS values compared to the first approach (144\% versus 108\% in 2016). The monthly-disaggregated WS at catchment scale exhibits a similar increasing trend. The highest WS values are at the end of the fall and during the summer season, which is mainly due to the increasing demand for irrigation and drinking water. Siliana region is the most affected by WS, while Beja is the least affected. The FOUA shows that the integration of remote sensing-based irrigation data reduces the WS uncertainty.

TI  - Maxent Modeling For Predicting The Potential Distribution Of Valeriana Jatamansi Jones. In Chakrata Forest Division Of Garhwal Himalaya
JO  - Indian Journal of Ecology
AB  - Valeriana jatamansi is distributed in subtropical to the temperate regions between 1000 to 3000m in Himalayas. Its' population is decreasing at an alarming rate to meet the demand of pharmaceutical industries and is placed under endangered categories. The present study was attained to depict its potential distribution in Chakrata forest division. For modeling procedure, Worldclim bioclimatic variables along with slope, aspect, elevation, forest types (based on Sentinel-2) data and 50 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution in the 1164.23 km2 study area. The suitable habitat for V. jatamansi was recorded 207 km2. The temperature (31%) and precipitation (15%) where is the key influential factors that affects its distribution. Jacknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modelling. Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 0.89. The findings can be applied in various ways such as species restoration and conservation planning, identification of additional localities where V. jatamansi may already exist but has not yet been detected. This approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of medicinal plant species. © 2021 Ecological Society of India. All rights reserved.

TI  - Notice Of Retraction: Evolution Of The Channel Geomorphology And Flood Management Countermeasures Of The Middle And Lower Yangtze River
JO  - 2010 2nd Conference on Environmental Science and Information Application Technology, ESIAT 2010
AB  - River channel geomorphologic evolution is the basis of flood control and regulation. With the information of satellite images and field investigation, the article emphatically analyzes the geomorphologic evolution characteristics and stability of meandering channels and gooseneck-bifurcated channel, both of which are the most typical and unstable types in the middle and lower Yangtze River. Evolution of meandering channels has characteristics of periodicity and length constraint. The fractal dimension of Lower-lingjiang is between l.078 and l.23. When it reaches a value between l.19 and l.23, river channel goes to an unstable status, in that case the fractal dimension will have mutation from big to small, because of the channel cutoff. Stone serving as node, heart-shape beach, branch inflow are the main conditions of the forming of gooseneck-bending channel. Most gooseneck-bifurcated channel has the characteristics of periodicity integer nested translation. Recently most of the left branches are at the stage of bankrupt-siltation-bank combined. Lower-lingjiang meandering channel has the characteristics of variability at the transverse direction and linkage at the vertical direction, so river regulation should be based on the whole part of the river. Bifurcated channel below Chenglingji should be governed from different units according to the node. More branches, more unstable the channel will become, besides, the branch also has the characteristics of linkage, and so all branches should be treated as an entirety when having the river regulation. ©2010 IEEE.

TI  - Pathfinding Of 2d & 3d Game Real-Time Strategy With Depth Direction A* Algorithm For Multi-Layer
JO  - 2009 8th International Symposium on Natural Language Processing, SNLP '09
AB  - The pathfinding analysis has importance for various working such as logistics, transportation, operation management, system analysis and design, project management, network and production line. Especially, game programming technology has effect to economic and dominates culture, increasingly. The shortest path analysis is artificial intelligent which developed capability about think cause and effect, learning and thinking like human. Heuristic technique is method for solving a problem which gets result or not. It may return unexpected value which depends on each problem. 3D game realtime strategy uses shortest path analysis control path for movement of character, wheeled vehicle, animals, and fantasy buildings. It uses path for movement ever time, both in sea, terra and sky (three layers). The position of 3D object use refers 2D coordinate. Generally, the most of 3D game strategy both on LAN and online will play on terrain more than inside building or the room. This research proposes two essences.

Besides, this research proposes Depth Direction A* algorithm method which new method which use linear graph theory cooperate with A* Algorithm calculate increase efficiency of avoid barrier object on maps and search for shortest path of multi-layer. It movement are natural characteristic more other method. The cost node grows less than A* algorithm in clear area and plan about expand node before processed. It guarantee about expand node less than A* algorithm node certainly. It takes time movement and avoid barrier object less than uses other algorithm. This work able decrease expand node 22.12-70.67% depend on property of area between pathway by define 3D rendering rate are stable. © 2009 IEEE.

TI  - Smos-Next: A New Concept For Soil Moisture Retrieval From Passive Interferometric Observations
AB  - Present soil moisture and ocean salinity maps retrieved by remote sensing are characterized by a coarse spatial resolution. Hydrological, meteorological and climatological applications would benefit greatly from a better spatial resolution. Owing to the dimensions of the satellite structure and to the degradation of the instrument's radiometric sensitivity, such improvement cannot be achieved with classical interferometry. Then, in order to achieve this goal an original concept for passive interferometric measurements is described. This concept should allow to achieve a much finer spatial resolution, which can be further improved with the application of disaggregation methods. The results will then allow the integration of global soil moisture maps into hydrological models, a better management of water resources at small scales and an improvement in spatial precision for various applications. https://www.edp-open.org/images/stories/books/fulldl/eas\_59/eas59\_pp20 3-212.pdf

TI  - Mangrove Vulnerability Modelling In Parts Of Western Niger Delta, Nigeria Using Satellite Images, Gis Techniques And Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis (Smca)
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Mangroves are known for their global environmental and socioeconomic value. Despite their importance, mangrove like other ecosystems is now being threatened by natural and human-induced processes that damage them at alarming rates, thereby diminishing the limited number of existing mangrove vegetation. The development of a spatial vulnerability assessment model that takes into consideration environmental and socioeconomic criteria, in spatial and non-spatial formats has been attempted in this study. According to the model, 11 different input parameters are required in modelling mangrove vulnerability. These parameters and their effects on mangrove vulnerability were selected and weighted by experts in the related fields. Criteria identification and selection were mainly based on effects of environmental and socioeconomic changes associated with mangrove survival. The results obtained revealed the dominance of socioeconomic criteria such as population pressure and deforestation, with high vulnerability index of 0.75. The environmental criteria was broadly dispersed in the study area and represents vulnerability indices ranging from 0.00-0.75. This category reflects the greater influence of pollutant input from oil wells and pipelines and minimal contribution from climatic factors. This project has integrated spatial management framework for mangrove vulnerability assessment that utilises information technology in conjunction with expert knowledge and multi-criteria analysis to aid planners and policy/ decision makers in the protection of this very fragile ecosystem.

TI  - A Typhoon Center Location Method On Satellite Images Based On Deep Reinforcement Learning
JO  - Chinese Control Conference, CCC
AB  - The location of the typhoon center is a key technology for analyzing and forecasting typhoons as well as reducing typhoon disasters. Varied patterns, blurred borders, and uncertain centers of the typhoons in the satellite images make the task challenging. In this work, a method based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to locate the typhoon center. It turns the problem of typhoon center locating into an issue of searching and views the process of searching for the typhoon center as a series of Markov Decision Processes. Specifically, the agent learns to move and reduce a search box using simple transformation actions to make the search box center close to the typhoon center. Meanwhile, discriminant rules for detecting typhoons are designed based on the relationship of selected action and its value function. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can complete the locating of typhoons of different grades and types in about 16 steps. The recall of the proposed method increases with the typhoon level and reaches 100% at grade 5 and 6, and the average precision reaches 91.85%. The proposed method can effectively locate typhoon centers in different forms with a mean absolute error of 0.265°, which is superior to the comparison algorithms. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.

TI  - Sar Data For Tropical Forest Disturbance Alerts In French Guiana: Benefit Over Optical Imagery
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - French Guiana forests cover 8 million hectares. With 98\% of emerged land covered by forests, French Guiana is the area with the highest proportion of forest cover in the world. These forests are home to an exceptionally rich and diverse wealth of biodiversity that is both vulnerable and under threat due to high levels of pressure from human activity. As part of the French territory, French Guiana benefits from determined and continuous national efforts in the preservation of biodiversity and the environmental functionalities of ecosystems. The loss and fragmentation of forest cover caused by gold mining (legal and illegal), smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation, are considered as small-scale disturbances, although representing strong effects to vulnerable natural habitats, landscapes, and local populations. To monitor forest management programs and combat illegal deforestation and forest opening near-real time alerts system based on remote sensing data are required. For this large territory under frequent cloud cover, Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data appear to be the best adapted. In this paper, a method for forest alerts in a near-real time context based on Sentinel-1 data over the whole of French Guiana (83,534 km2) was developed and evaluated. The assessment was conducted for 2 years between 2016 and 2018 and includes comparisons with reference data provided by French Guiana forest organizations and comparisons with the existing University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery Forest Alerts datasets based on Landsat data. The reference datasets include 1,867 plots covering 2,124.5 ha of gold mining, smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation. The validation results showed high user accuracies (96.2\%) and producer accuracies (81.5\%) for forest loss detection, with the latter much higher than for optical forest alerts (36.4\%). The forest alerts maps were also compared in terms of detection timing, showing systematic temporal delays of up to one year in the optical method compared to the SAR method. These results highlight the benefits of SAR over optical imagery for forest alerts detection in French Guiana. Finally, the potential of the SAR method applied to tropical forests is discussed. The SAR-based map of this study is available on http://cesbiomass.net/.

TI  - Drought Impact Assessment Based On Principal Component Analysis And Copula Function
JO  - Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery
AB  - Drought is one of the most important agricultural disasters in the Guanzhong Plain, China. Assessing the influence of the droughts in the plain accurately can provide reference for drought mitigation and maintaining stable crop yields. Based on remotely sensed vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) which was calculated at ten-day intervals for monitoring droughts in the years of 2008-2013 in the plain, the Copula function method was used to assess the effect of drought at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yields. The mutually independent principal factors were extracted from the VTCIs at the main growth stages of winter wheat by using principal component analysis (PCA), overcoming difficulty of parameter estimation for multivariate Copula, and then incorporated into the Copula function to establish a PCA-Copula method. The comprehensive values of VTCIs at the main growth stages were determined by the PCA-Copula method, and then linear regression model between the comprehensive VTCIs and wheat yields was established to assess the effect of drought on the yields. The results showed that the linear correlation coefficient between the wheat yields and comprehensive VTCIs was at the extremely significant level (P<0.001). Compared with the linear regression model based on the entropy value method, the determination coefficient of the model with the PCA-Copula method reached 0.49 from 0.39, which indicated that the fitting degree of the model was improved, and the root mean square error and average relative error between the estimated and measured yields reduced by 30.2 kg/hm2 and 0.66%, respectively. These results indicated that the PCA-Copula method was a better approach for accessing the impact of droughts at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yield. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

JO  - Journal of Environmental and Occupational Medicine
AB  - Accumulating studies suggest that green space exposure is related to a variety of health benefits; however, limited studies have been conducted in China. We reviewed the methods of exposure assessment, study designs, and main findings of previous studies regarding to green space exposure and its acute and chronic health effects. In the aspect of exposure assessments, different types of indicators were employed in the epidemiological studies, such as land use types of green space, greenness index retrieved from satellite remote sensing data, and green space expsosure data extracted from the images of street view. Epidemiological studies of green space exposure have the following features: 1) The majority of the studies were conducted in developed countries rather than developing ones; 2) Green space exposure was suggested to have potential health effects in various stages of the life cycle from pregnancy, infancy, adolescence, adulthood to senior years; 3) Results were consistent that exposure to green space might improve birth weight and be protective against mortality, whereas failed to be consistent on other health outcomes; 4) The mechanisms of health benefits of green space were still unclear. © 2021, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

TI  - An Ecological Land Classification Approach To Modeling The Production Of Forest Biomass
JO  - FORESTRY CHRONICLE
AB  - Forest site classification is a prerequisite to successful integrated forest resources planning and management. Traditionally, site classification has emphasized a phytocentric approach, with tools such as the site index having a rich and long history in forest site evaluation. The concept of site index was primarily devised to assess site productivity of an even-aged, single-species stand. Site index has been the primary method of forest site evaluation in support of management for traditional forest products. However, this method of site classification has been criticized as the needs, perspectives and social values of the public regarding forest management have changed the emphasis from timber production to multiple-value forestry practices. There are alternative approaches to forest site classification that have the potential to meet the growing demands placed on forest information for inventory and modeling purposes. Ecological Land Classification (ELC), is a phytogeocentric approach that stratifies the landscape into ecologically meaningful units (ecosites) based on substrate characteristics, moisture regime and canopy composition. This approach offers a more holistic view of site productivity evaluation; however, until recently it has been difficult to acquire data to support widespread mapping of ecosites. Remote sensing technology along with predictive modeling and interpretive mapping techniques make the application of an ecosite-based approach at the forest landscape level possible. As forest management moves towards the consideration of a broader set of resources (e.g., woody biomass), there is an opportunity to develop new tools for linking forest productivity to the sustainable production of forest bioproducts with forest ecosites as a solid foundation for segmenting the landscape.

TI  - Monte-Carlo Siamese Policy On Actor For Satellite Image Super Resolution
JO  - IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops
AB  - In the past few years supervised and adversarial learning have been widely adopted in various complex computer vision tasks. It seems natural to wonder whether another branch of artificial intelligence, commonly known as Reinforcement Learning (RL) can benefit such complex vision tasks. In this study, we explore the plausible usage of RL in super resolution of remote sensing imagery. Guided by recent advances in super resolution, we propose a theoretical framework that leverages the benefits of supervised and reinforcement learning. We argue that a straightforward implementation of RL is not adequate to address ill-posed super resolution as the action variables are not fully known. To tackle this issue, we propose to parameterize action variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling. We study the implications of parametric action space in a model-free environment from theoretical and empirical perspective. Furthermore, we analyze the quantitative and qualitative results on both remote sensing and non-remote sensing datasets. Based on our experiments, we report considerable improvement over state-of-the-art methods by encapsulating supervised models in a reinforcement learning framework. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Validation Of Timi And Grace Acute Coronary Risk Scores In Alexandria Governorate And Their Role In The Comparison Of Quality Of Care Between Hospitals
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE EGYPTIAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background: Risk stratification in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) aims to identify those patients who might benefit prognostically from further investigation and treatment. In addition, risk stratification models have been used by health authorities and hospitals in quality management activities. Aim: The present study aimed at validating the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores for prediction of mortality in patients with ACS in Alexandria governorate. In addition, the study aimed also at using one of the validated risk scores to compare risk adjusted mortality among participating hospitals. Material and Methods: The study was conducted at hospitals belonging to 3 different health care organizations in Alexandria. All admitted patients with the diagnosis of ACS throughout a period of 6 months were included in the study (n=606). Discriminatory capacity and calibration of the TIMI and GRACE risk scores for detection of in-hospital mortality and mortality within six months of index admission were assessed. Results: The study showed that both TIMI and GRACE risk scores had high c statistics of 0.70 or higher. GRACE scores showed equal or higher c statistics than TIMI scores denoting better discriminatory capacity. TIMI risk score showed good calibration while GRACE risk score showed lower calibration capacity with certain patient categories. The GRACE risk score was used to calculate the standardized in-hospital mortality ratio which was higher than 1 for all participating hospitals indicating higher than expected mortality for ACS patients in these hospitals. Conclusions and recommendations: GRACE risk score showed good discriminatory capacity, suggesting that it is suitable for clinical use among ACS patients in Alexandria governorate. It was recommended to use GRACE risk score for risk adjustment in quality management activities.

TI  - Inbound Arrivals: Using Weather Surveillance Radar To Quantify The Diurnal Timing Of Spring Trans-Gulf Bird Migration
JO  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - More than two billion birds migrate through the Gulf of Mexico each spring en route to breeding grounds in the USA and Canada. This region has a long history of complex natural and anthropogenic environments as the northern Gulf coast provides the first possible stopover habitats for migrants making nonstop trans-Gulf crossings during spring migration. However, intense anthropogenic activity in the region, which is expanding rapidly at present, makes migrants vulnerable to a multitude of obstacles and increasingly fragments and alters these habitats. Understanding the timing of migrants' overwater arrivals has biological value for expanding our understanding of migration ecology relative to decision-making for nonstop flights, and is imperative for advancing conservation of this critical region through the identification of key times in which to direct conservation actions (e.g. temporary halting of wind turbines, reduction of light pollution). We explored 10 years of weather surveillance radar data from five sites along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast to quantify the daily timing and intensity of arriving trans-Gulf migrants. On a daily scale, we found that migrant intensity peaked an average of nine hours after local sunrise, occurring earliest at easternmost sites. On a seasonal level, the greatest number of arrivals occurred between late April and early May, with peak intensity occurring latest at westernmost sites. Overall intensity of migration across all 10 years of data was greatest at the westernmost sites and decreased moving farther to the east. These findings emphasize the differential spatial and temporal patterns of use of the Gulf of Mexico region by migrating birds, information that is essential for improving our understanding of the ecology of trans-Gulf migration and for supporting data-driven approaches to conservation actions for the migratory birds passing through this critical region.

TI  - Systematic Monitoring Of Heathy Woodlands In A Mediterranean Climate - A Practical Assessment Of Methods
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
AB  - Practical and useful vegetation monitoring methods are needed, and data compatibility and validation of remotely sensed data are desirable. Methods have not been adequately tested for heathy woodlands. We tested the feasibility of detecting species composition shifts in remnant woodland in South Australia, comparing historical (1986) plot data with temporal replicates (2010). We compared the uniformity of species composition among spatially scattered versus spatially clustered plots. At two sites, we compared visual and point-intercept estimation of cover and species diversity. Species composition (presence/absence) shifted between 1986 and 2010. Species that significantly shifted in frequency had low cover. Observations of decreasing species were consistent with predictions from temperature response curves (generalised additive models) for climate change over the period. However, long-term trends could not be distinguished from medium-term dynamics or short-term changes in visibility from this dataset. Difficulties were highlighted in assessing compositional change using historical baselines established for a different purpose in terms of spatial sampling and accuracy of replicate plots, differences in standard plot methods and verification of species identifications. Spatially clustered replicate plots were more similar in species composition than spatially scattered plots, improving change detection potential but decreasing area of inference. Visual surveys detected more species than point-intercepts. Visual cover estimates differed little from point-intercepts although underestimating cover in some instances relative to intercepts. Point-intercepts provide more precise cover estimates of dominant species but took longer and were difficult in steep, heathy terrain. A decision tree based on costs and benefits is presented assessing monitoring options based on data presented. The appropriate method is a function of available resources, the need for precise cover estimates versus adequate species detection, replication and practical considerations such as access and terrain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Estimation Of No<Sub>2</Sub> Emission Strengths Over Riyadh And Madrid From Space From A Combination Of Wind-Assigned Anomalies And A Machine Learning Technique
JO  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution provides valuable information for quantifying NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions and exposures. This study presents a comprehensive method to estimate average tropospheric NO2 emission strengths derived from 4-year (May 2018-June 2022) TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations by combining a wind-assigned anomaly approach and a machine learning (ML) method, the so-called gradient descent algorithm. This combined approach is firstly applied to the Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh, as a test site, and yields a total emission rate of 1:09 x 1026 molec. s(-1). The ML-trained anomalies fit very well with the wind-assigned anomalies, with an R-2 value of 1.0 and a slope of 0.99. Hotspots of NO2 emissions are apparent at several sites: over a cement plant and power plants as well as over areas along highways. Using the same approach, an emission rate of 1 :99 x 10(25) molec. s(-1) is estimated in the Madrid metropolitan area, Spain. Both the estimate and spatial pattern are comparable with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory. Weekly variations in NO2 emission are highly related to anthropogenic activities, such as the transport sector. The NO2 emissions were reduced by 16\% at weekends in Riyadh, and high reductions were found near the city center and in areas along the highway. An average weekend reduction estimate of 28\% was found in Madrid. The regions with dominant sources are located in the east of Madrid, where residential areas and the Madrid-Barajas airport are located. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, the NO2 emissions decreased by 21\% in March-June 2020 in Riyadh compared with the same period in 2019. A much higher reduction (62 \%) is estimated for Madrid, where a very strict lockdown policy was implemented. The high emission strengths during lockdown only persist in the residential areas, and they cover smaller areas on weekdays compared with weekends. The spatial patterns of NO2 emission strengths during lockdown are similar to those observed at weekends in both cities. Although our analysis is limited to two cities as test examples, the method has proven to provide reliable and consistent results. It is expected to be suitable for other trace gases and other target regions. However, it might become challenging in some areas with complicated emission sources and topography, and specific NO2 decay times in different regions and seasons should be taken into account. These impacting factors should be considered in the future model to further reduce the uncertainty budget.

TI  - Characteristics Of Selected Peatland Uses And Soil Moisture Based On Tvdi
JO  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - The conversion of peatland from forest to non-forest causes environmental damage and increases high land dryness. Mapping of peatland based on dryness is very important to control and prevent fires. This study aims at characterizing peatland based on the level of temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and evaluating the correlation between TVDI value and soil moisture. The research was conducted in August 2018 during the dry season. The area of research located in peat hydrological unit of Sibumbung River - Batok River in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) District of South Sumatra Province covering 63,427 ha area that consists of various land uses. The result showed that extreme wet category is found in water bodies and secondary forests that have high density, moderate wet is found in paddy fields and grass, normal area is found in the area covered by low-density trees, moderate dry is found in shrubs and oil palm plantations with good management and extreme dry areas is found in grasses and oil palm with poor cultivation management. There is a correlation between the TVDI value to the soil moisture on 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm depth.

TI  - Lake Nasser Evaporation Reduction Study
JO  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED RESEARCH
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the reduction of evaporation of Lake Nasser's water caused by disconnecting (fully or partially) some of its secondary channels (khors). This evaluation integrates remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, aerodynamic principles, and Landsat7 ETM+ images. Three main procedures were carried out in this study; the first derived the surface temperature from Landsat thermal band; the second derived evaporation depth and approximate evaporation volume for the entire lake, and quantified evaporation loss to the secondary channels' level over one month (March) by applied aerodynamic principles on surface temperature of the raster data; the third procedure applied GIS suitability analysis to determine which of these secondary channels (khors) should be disconnected. The results showed evaporation depth ranging from 2.73 mm/day at the middle of the lake to 9.58 mm/day at the edge. The evaporated water-loss value throughout the entire lake was about 0.86 billion m(3) /month (March). The analysis suggests that it is possible to save an approximate total evaporation volume loss of 19.7 million m(3) / month (March), and thus 2.4 billion m(3) /year, by disconnecting two khors with approximate construction heights of 8 m and 15 m. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS are useful for applications in remote locations where field-based information is not readily available and thus recommended for decision makers remotely planning in water conservation and management.

AB  - Modern Disaster Management Systems are based on several columns that combine theory and practice, software, and hardware being under technological advance. In all parts, spatial data is key in order to analyze existing structure, assist in risk assessment and update the information after a disaster incident. This paper focus on technological advances in several fields of spatial analysis putting together the advantages, limitations and technological aspects from well-known or even innovative methods, highlighting the huge potential of nowadays technologies for the field of Disaster Risk Management (DRM). A focus then is lying on GIS and Remote Sensing technologies that are showing the potential of high-quality sensors and image products that are getting easier to access and captured with recent technology. Secondly, several relevant sensors being thermal or laser-based are introduced pointing out the application possibilities, their limits, and potential fusion of them. Emphasis is further driven to Machine Learning techniques adopted from Artificial Intelligence that improve algorithms for auto-detection and represent an important step forwards to an integrated system of spatial data use in the Disaster Management Cycle. The combination of Multi-Sensor Systems, new Platform technologies, and Machine Learning indeed creates a very important benefit for the future. . © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

TI  - Landslide Detection In Central America Using The Differential Bare Soil Index
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
AB  - The increasing availability of EO data from the Copernicus program through its Sentinel satellites of the medium spatial and spectral resolution has generated new applications for risk management and disaster management. The recent growth in the intensity and number of hurricanes and earthquakes has demanded an increase in the monitoring of landslides. It is necessary to monitor large areas at a detailed level, which has previously been unsatisfactory due to its reliance on the interpretation of aerial photographs and the cost of high-resolution images. Using the differential Bare Soil Index for optical imagery interpretation in combination with cloud-computing in Google Earth Engine is a novel approach. Applying this method on a recent landslide event in Oaxaca in Mexico around 62% of the landslides were detected automatically, however, there is a big potential for improvement. Including NDVI values and considering images with a higher spatial resolution could contribute to the enhancement of landslide detection, as the majority of missed events have a size smaller than half a pixel. Landslide detection in Google Earth Engine has become a promising approach for big data processing and landslide inventory creation. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

TI  - Assessing Debris Flow Susceptibility In Heshigten Banner, Inner Mongolia, China, Using Principal Component Analysis And An Improved Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm
JO  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Susceptibility analysis is important in any study of debris flows. Unlike debris flows in Southwest China, debris flows in Northern China occur with different characteristics and much lower frequency. However, neglecting the danger of possible debris flows in this northern area may result in a devastating disaster. In this paper, 12 debris flow catchments located near Zhirui town, in Heshigten Banner, Inner Mongolia, China, were investigated. A geographic information system, a global positioning system, and remote sensing were used to determine geological, topographical, morphological, and vegetation factors of influence. Principal component analysis was carried out to convert this set of possibly correlated factors into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated principal components. The accumulative contribution rate of the first five principal components retained most of the information on these factors, accounting for 90.9 \%. An improved fuzzy C-means clustering analysis was applied to determine the susceptibility of debris flows in this area. This method is based on a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is an evolutionary algorithm that can achieve global optimization, and is not sensitive to the initial cluster centers. Results showed that the susceptibility levels for four of the debris flow catchments were high, six were moderate, and two were low. Our quantitative assessments based on these nonlinear methods were consistent with field investigations.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing For Assessing The Spatiotemporal Changes Of The Ecological State Of The Agricultural Lands In Armenia
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
AB  - Proper management and monitoring of the ecological condition of natural feeders are crucial for both the economy and natural environments. Armenia is no exception, and addressing this issue requires comprehensive studies combining traditional methods with remote sensing technologies. Remote sensing in agriculture utilizes various sensors and technologies to collect data about crops, soil conditions, and agricultural parameters from a distance. This study focuses on the utilization of remote sensing, including satellite imagery, to assess the ecological state of grasslands and pastures in the Syunik administrative district of Armenia. Over a 22-year period (2000-2021), the study utilized Landsat series (5,7,8) multispectral optical images processed through Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyze changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of vegetation health. The results reveal favorable trends in vegetation health across the study regions, as indicated by consistently positive Z-values in the Seasonal Mann-Kendall test. While no significant trends were observed in some areas, others showed improvements in biomass conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the resilience and health of grasslands and pastures in the Sisian and Goris regions, offering a basis for targeted interventions and strategies to preserve these ecosystems for future generations. © Author(s) 2023.

TI  - Investigation Of Seasonal Dust In Northeastern Iran And Numerical Simulation Of Extreme Dust Events Using Wrf-Chem Model
JO  - Journal of the Earth and Space Physics
AB  - In recent years, dust storm has become a serious environmental concern and has attracted a lot of attention among atmospheric scientists. Northeast of Iran is a large and strategic population area. Due to its proximity to large arid regions in Central Asia, this region has a high risk of experiensing dust events. In recent years, it has faced many problems regarding dust phenomena. This study is conducted to investigate seasonal dust events in northeastern Iran. To achieve this goal, a combination of station data, reanalysis, satellite and output of the WRF-Chem numerical model have been used simultaneously to improve our understanding of the dust seasonal cycle in northeast of Iran. Accordingly, this research was organized in two parts: monitoring and modeling of dust phenomenon. The results of this study may be useful for forecasting dust storms as well as spatial planning. To investigate the dust events seasonal variabilities, the dust surface mass concentration of MERRA-2 dataset, aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the combined Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms of MODIS sensor of Terra and Aqua satellites were examined during the long-term period (2004-2018). Since the emission of dust is highly dependent on biophysical components, it is necessary to use numerical models. The WRF-Chem numerical model was used for this purpose. The study area includes northeastern Iran and parts of Central Asia. The horizontal resolution of the child domin of 30 km model was performed with 32 vertical levels. The NCEP/FNL is used as boundary conditions with 3-hourly time step and 1-degree horizontal resolution for the model configuration. Four extreme dust events were selected to investigate the transport of dust to northeastern Iran. The selected dust events occurred on November 13, 2007, May 29, 2008, June 8, 2015, and October 17, 2017 in northeastern Iran. Therefore, case events were simulated with a time step of 180 seconds and output every three hours using GOCART, AFWA, UoC_S01 and UoC_S11 schemes. The results showed that the maximum dust activity occurred in spring with AOD value equal to 0.59 and dust surface mass concentration is 645.2 µg m -3. The summer is in the next place. Seasonal analysis of AOD and dust using satellite and reanalysis data, showed that Aralkum, Kyzylkum, Karakum and Kara-Bogaz-Gol are the main dust sources in Central Asia that are active in all seasons. Comparison of dust simulation results for PM2.5 and PM10 variable with observational data of air quality control stations in Mashhad showed that GOCART scheme can well depict dust events and provide a low bias towards station data. Also, the study of correlation coefficient between simulation and observation showed that the GOCART scheme explains nearly 90% of the variance of data. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the GOCART scheme is less than 20 micrograms per cubic meter for PM2.5. Accordingly, the GOCART scheme is a suitable scheme for dust study in Northeast of Iran and the WRF-Chem model can be used to operationally forecast dust storms. The dust detection algorithm (DDA) of the AIRS sensor and the aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the MODIS sensor confirm the contribution of the mentioned sources of dust in transferring dust to the northeast of Iran. The results showed that three of the case studies occurred as a result of the passage of an extratropical Rossby wave and the deepening of the trough on the territory of Turkmenistan. In contrast, the summer case study is the result of the establishment of a summer circulation pattern that has occurred with the simultaneous establishment of an anticyclonic circulation in the southern part of Turkmenistan and the northeastern parts of Iran and a cyclonic circulation in the Sistan plain and southeastern parts of the country. © 2022 Institute of Geophysics.

TI  - Trends Of Resistance To Antimicrobials Recommended Currently And In The Past For Management Of Gonorrhea In The Apex Std Center In India And Comparison Of Antimicrobial Resistance Profile Between 2002-2006 And 2007-2012
JO  - Sexually Transmitted Diseases
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae jeopardizes public health and continues to spread out to currently recommended and older antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance provides essential clues toward the modification of treatment guidelines. The aim of the study was to determine gonococcal AMR profile and trends between 2007 and 2012 and to evaluate any change in AMR profile in comparison with published trends in 2002 to 2006. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 261 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from consecutive patients between 2007 and 2012 was determined for penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefixime, cefpodoxime) and azithromycin by the disk diffusion technique and the Etest method. P value was determined using χ2 test for comparisons of trends between the 2 periods. Results: In comparison of AMR trends between 2002-2006 and 2007-2012, penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains increased significantly from 21.2% to 47.9% (P < 0.0001), 13.6% to 25.3% (P = 0.0002), and 78% to 89.7% (P = 0.0001), respectively. An insignificant increase from 2.4% to 4.2% (P > 0.05) in decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and 0.8% to 1.5% (P > 0.05) for azithromycin resistance was observed. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin over both the periods, except for one isolate in 2002. Conclusions: The study highlights that there is a continuous increase in resistance to previously recommended antibiotics despite their disuse for treatment. The increase in number of strains with decreased susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and azithromycin resistance, currently recommended for management of gonorrhea, is of serious concern. These trends should be monitored continuously to change antibiotic policy. Copyright © 2015 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association All rights reserved.

TI  - Gis Based Land Information System For Mandal Soum, Selenge Aimag Of Mongolia
AB  - It is important to learn about and use Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing data and software for our profession nowadays. Modern technologies like geo-data processing and earth observation data processing and analysis are needed for Mongolian young researchers and students. This research work is dedicated to create a land information system over agricultural areas of Selenge Aimag (state), Mandal Soum (province) of Mongolia. One task of the work is to establish a land information database which is based on an Open Source Geographic Information System. Work is starting with acquisition of existing geodata and information, qualification, maintenance, utilization and transferring of data from one soum of Mongolia. Furthermore, the principles used for this soum will serve as a pilot and can be applied to other soums in Selenge Aimag and other agricultural areas of Mongolia. This research work will be helpful to establish a structured cadastral database, multi user access to the database, avoid data redundancy of different organization and follow international standards for geographic information. The "Land Management and Fiscal Cadastre" (LMFC) project's aim is to develop a land valuation methodology based on a land information system for selected project areas. The project established already a cadastral database for Darkhan-Uul Aimag settlement area. Continuing work will be done for agricultural and rural area of Selenge, Mandal area. Promoting education and training at fundamental and professional level for land managers and students are vital for the establishment of land information systems in developing countries. The establishment of a land information system for Selenge Aimag will contribute to the National Land Information System of Mongolia. The project demonstrates that Land Information Systems can be created using Open Source GIS software as e. g. QuantumGIS, gvSIG, uDig and the Open Source database management system PostgreSQL /PostGIS. Systems which are based on Open Source GIS software are new for many professionals in Mongolia and of special importance for developing countries due to their cost efficiency. To connect this work to the practice, students of GIS-RS laboratory at Plant Science Agricultural Training Research Institute (PSARTI), which belongs to the State University of Agriculture of Mongolia, are taught as well as staff from other Government institutions. PSARTI works with several international institutes and projects in different fields. The results of the project activities are shared and advise about the use of Open Source GIS software for different education, research and professional level is given, using the establishment of a land information system with complete land coverage and multi cadastral functions in Mongolia. Promoting the use of Open Source GIS software, enhancing data quality and knowledge exchange are the main aims to be followed further. It is important to experiment and use the project results on a national level and to provide education on Geographic Information Science and Systems to researchers and land managers, students in the land management and administration sector. The results will promote good governance and provide fact based information to decision makers and government.

TI  - A Comparative Study Of Built-Up Index Approaches For Automated Extraction Of Built-Up Regions From Remote Sensing Data
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Accurate built-up information is imperative for loss estimation and disaster management after the occurrence of catastrophic events such as earthquake, tornado, tsunami and flood. These catastrophic events leave behind a trail of mass destruction with property and human losses amounting to millions. Once a natural disaster hits a region, built-up information is required within a short span of time for disaster management. Nowadays, earth observation satellite imagery serves as a promising source to extract the land use / land cover classes. However, the automatic extraction of urban built-up from remote sensing data is a known challenge in the remote sensing community. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) algorithm has been recognized as an effective algorithm for automatic built-up identification from medium spatial and spectral resolution satellite images. Few researchers have modified this algorithm and proposed new quantitative expressions for the built-up index. In this paper, three built-up index based, unsupervised built-up extraction algorithms have been reviewed and compared. An automated kernel-based probabilistic thresholding algorithm is used to assort the built-up index values, obtained from modified built-up index algorithms, into built-up and non built-up regions for enhancing the efficiency of the built-up detection process. Qualitative assessment of these algorithms involves computation of several parameters including recently developed parameters like allocation disagreement and quantity disagreement, and classical parameters such as error of omission, error of commission and overall accuracy. This paper presents a case study where the algorithms have been implemented on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the city of Delhi and its surrounding areas for detection of built-up regions automatically.

TI  - Increased Water Use Efficiency In China And Its Drivers During 2000–2016
JO  - Ecosystems
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), the carbon uptake per unit of water consumption, is a critical indicator of the coupling between water and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the spatiotemporal changes in WUE and its drivers is vital for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Herein, we used a remote sensing-driven analytical model to estimate spatiotemporal variations of WUE in China during 2000–2016 and quantified its key drivers. The simulated WUE matched well with the eddy covariance observations across different ecosystems in China, with coefficients of determination of 0.86 and 0.81. The annual WUE increased significantly at a rate of 0.021 g C mm−1 H2O y−1 (P < 0.01), with the mean value of 1.62 g C mm−1 H2O during 2000–2016. Analyses based on a factorial experiment (FE) and the sensitivity method (SE) showed that the increased leaf area index was the largest contributor to the increase in WUE, with contributions of 50.1% and 42.8% determined via FE and SE, respectively. CO2 enrichment was the second largest contributor (FE: 20.7% and SE: 31.4%), followed by the decrease in the vapor pressure deficit (FE: 15.4% and SE: 13.4%). The increased ratio of water loss by canopy interaction had a negative impact on WUE due to the increased non-productive water loss. Although these attributions had some inherent uncertainties, the results highlighted that the significant greening in China, which was mainly caused by human land-use management, and increased CO2 concentrations significantly promoted WUE during the recent 17 years. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Evaluation Of The Utilization Potential Of High-Resolution Optical Satellite Images In Port Ship Management: A Case Study On Berth Utilization In Busan New Port
JO  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Over the past 20 years, Korea's overall import and export cargo volume has increased at an average annual rate of approximately 5.3\%. About 99\% of the cargo is still being transported by sea. Due to recent increases in maritime cargo volume, congestion in maritime logistics has become challenging due to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts. Continuous monitoring of ports has become crucial. Various ground observation systems and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data have been utilized for monitoring ports and conducting numerous preliminary studies for the efficient operation of container terminals and cargo volume prediction. However, small and developing countries' ports face difficulties in monitoring due to environmental issues and aging infrastructure compared to large ports. Recently, with the increasing utility of artificial satellites, preliminary studies have been conducted using satellite imagery for continuous maritime cargo data collection and establishing ocean monitoring systems in vast and hard-to-reach areas. This study aims to visually detect ships docked at berths in the Busan New Port using high-resolution satellite imagery and quantitatively evaluate berth utilization rates. By utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery from Compact Advanced Satellite 500-1 (CAS500-1), Korea Multi-Purpose satellite-3 (KOMPSAT-3), PlanetScope, and Sentinel 2A, ships docked within the port berths were visually detected. The berth utilization rate was calculated using the total number of ships that could be docked at the berths. The results showed variations in berth utilization rates on June 2, 2022, with values of 0.67, 0.7, and 0.59, indicating fluctuations based on the time of satellite image capture. On June 3, 2022, the value remained at 0.7, signifying a consistent berth utilization rate despite changes in ship types. A higher berth utilization rate indicates active operations at the berth. This information can assist in basic planning for new ship operation schedules, as congested berths can lead to longer waiting times for ships in anchorages, potentially resulting in increased freight rates. The duration of operations at berths can vary from several hours to several days. The results of calculating changes in ships at berths based on differences in satellite image capture times, even with a time difference of 4 minutes and 49 seconds, demonstrated variations in ship presence. With short observation intervals and the utilization of high-resolution satellite imagery, continuous monitoring within ports can be achieved. Additionally, utilizing satellite imagery to monitor changes in ships at berths in minute increments could prove useful for small and developing country ports where harbor management is not well-established, offering valuable insights and solutions.

TI  - Investigating The Uncertainties Propagation Analysis Of Co2 Emissions Gridded Maps At The Urban Scale: A Case Study Of Jinjiang City, China
JO  - Remote Sensing
AB  - Gridded CO2 emission maps at the urban scale can aid the design of low-carbon development strategies. However, the large uncertainties associated with such maps increase policy-related risks. Therefore, an investigation of the uncertainties in gridded maps at the urban scale is essential. This study proposed an analytic workflow to assess uncertainty propagation during the gridding process. Gridded CO2 emission maps were produced using two resolutions of geospatial datasets (e.g., remote sensing satellite-derived products) for Jinjiang City, China, and a workflow was applied to analyze uncertainties. The workflow involved four submodules that can be used to evaluate the uncertainties of CO2 emissions in gridded maps, caused by the gridded model and input. Fine-resolution (30 m) maps have a larger spatial variation in CO2 emissions, which gives the fine-resolution maps a higher degree of uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, the uncertainties of gridded CO2 emission maps, caused by inserting a random error into spatial proxies, were found to decrease after the gridding process. This can be explained by the “compensation of error” phenomenon, which may be attributed to the cancellation of the overestimated and underestimated values among the different sectors at the same grid. This indicates a nonlinear change between the sum of the uncertainties for different sectors and the actual uncertainties in the gridded maps. In conclusion, the present workflow determined uncertainties were caused by the gridded model and input. These results may aid decision-makers in establishing emission reduction targets, and in developing both low-carbon cities and community policies. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Mapping Evapotranspiration Variability Over A Complex Oasis-Desert Ecosystem Based On Automated Calibration Of Landsat 7 Etm+ Data In Sebal
JO  - GISCIENCE \& REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Fragmented ecosystems of the desiccated Aral Sea seek answers to the profound local hydrologically- and water-related problems. Particularly, in the Small Aral Sea Basin (SASB), these problems are associated with low precipitation, increased temperature, land use and evapotranspiration (ET) changes. Here, the utility of high-resolution satellite dataset is employed to model the growing season dynamic of near-surface fluxes controlled by the advective effects of desert and oasis ecosystems in the SASB. This study adapted and applied the sensible heat flux calibration mechanism of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to 16 clear-sky Landsat 7 ETM+ dataset, following a guided automatic pixels search from surface temperature T-s and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI (). Results were comprehensively validated with flux components and actual ET (ETa) outputs of Eddy Covariance (EC) and Meteorological Station (KZL) observations located in the desert and oasis, respectively. Compared with the original SEBAL, a noteworthy enhancement of flux estimations was achieved as follows: - desert ecosystem ETa R-2 = 0.94; oasis ecosystem ETa R-2 = 0.98 (P < 0.05). The improvement uncovered the exact land use contributions to ETa variability, with average estimates ranging from 1.24 mm to 6.98 mm . Additionally, instantaneous ET to NDVI (ETins-NDVI) ratio indicated that desert and oasis consumptive water use vary significantly with time of the season. This study indicates the possibility of continuous daily ET monitoring with considerable implications for improving water resources decision support over complex data-scarce drylands.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Analysis Of Industrial Heat And Productivity In China
JO  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - China is currently in a key period of transformation and upgrading for its industrial infrastructure, and it is important to investigate the quantity, spatial distribution and production status of heat source industries to ensure effective supervision by environmental protection departments and to optimize the layout for regional industrial planning. In this study, based on the 2013-2019 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) I-band 375-m active fire data (VNP14IMG) product, a model combining density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and logistic regression (LR) was adopted to identify industrial heat source objects in China, and the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of industrial objects at different levels were analyzed. The results indicate the following: (1) the VNP14IMG-based DBSCAN-LR identification model feasibly identifies industrial heat sources, and the accuracy of cross-validation is 93\% and that of typical cities reaches as high as 92\%; (2) The number of industrial heat source objects (NIHSO) in China from 2013 to 2019 exhibits a general downward trend, with the NIHSO values from 2013 to 2019 being 2673, 2608, 2374, 2273, 2284, 2317, and 2269, respectively; (3) the spatial pattern of regional industrial development is extremely unbalanced and can be characterized as being "dense in the north and sparse in the south". The industrial focus has shifted southwest, reflecting advances in the central and western regions achieved through industrial transfer; (4) the global spatial autocorrelation of industrial distribution is positive, and the correlation increases over time. The local correlation shows that the geographic concentration characteristics of "high-high" agglomeration in the north and "low-low" agglomeration in the west.

TI  - Application Of Sentinel-1 Multi-Temporal Data For Crop Monitoring And Mapping
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique superiority has provided various opportunities in agricultural studies mainly on crop monitoring and management. This has resulted in many different investigations and improvements in crop growth monitoring, crop disaster prediction and providing accurate information to precise farming. In this study, a time-series of Sentinel-1 SAR images were acquired throughout the agricultural season synchronously with the field measurements to investigate the temporal backscatter changes for different crop types. From the backscattering analysis, it was observed that each similar crop type in different test fields due to the distinct methods of irrigation and fertilization has shown different intensity values. However, they all follow a roughly identical backscattering trend during growing stages of the crop and useful information can be extracted, such as estimating irrigation and harvesting time according to the changes made in backscatters. In comparing with ascending orbit in VH and VV polarizations it has indicated that the homogeneity between SAR backscatters is high for each field with the same crop type in descending pass direction with VH polarization. In contrary, high-intensity values are recorded in VV polarization for entire crop types. It is also observed that polarimetric composite images for a different date are useful to roughly identify crop types, and validated with the application of classification methods in the study area. As preliminary results, it is demonstrated that SAR data provide useful information about crops status. Hence, Sentinel-1 SAR data are ideal preference due to its free availability and constant long-term data archive. © 2019 R. Nasirzadehdizaji et al.

TI  - Evaluation Of Two End-Member-Based Models For Regional Land Surface Evapotranspiration Estimation From Modis Data
JO  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - The importance of accurate estimations of regional and global evapotranspiration (ET) has been recognized worldwide in the fields of hydrology, water resource management, meteorology, and global climate change. Given the different structures of the end-member-based surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) and surface temperature vegetation index (T-s-VI) triangle models, which nonetheless use essentially the same definitions of dry and wet pixels, questions arise regarding the nature of the differences between the two models' estimated sensible heat fluxes and latent heat fluxes and what controls the heat flux differences. This study aims to investigate how the SEBAL model and the T-s-VI triangle method differ from each other in the regional evaporative fraction (EF) and ET estimates through analytical deduction and model applications. Because both the SEBAL model and the T-s-VI triangle model are of limited use when deep-layer soil moisture is moderately to significantly stressed, MODIS remote sensing data from 23 clear-sky overpass times between January 2010 and late October 2011, covering a wide range of soil moisture content and fractional vegetation cover conditions, are acquired to assess the two models over a non-water stressed study area on the North China plain. The results show that the SEBAL model is able to produce satisfactory sensible heat flux (H) and latent heat flux (LE) estimates compared with ground-based large aperture scintillometer measurements at the Yucheng station, with small biases of 4.1 W/m(2) and 2.3 W/m(2) and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 46.4 W/m(2) and 48.6 W/m(2), respectively. However, the T-s-VI triangle model produces much worse H and LE estimates, with biases of 98.5 W/m(2) and 92.2 W/m(2) and RMSEs of 119.3 W/m(2) and 115.5 W/m(2), respectively. Variations of pixel-by-pixel surface available energy and momentum roughness length over the study area are responsible for the differences of the H and LE estimates between the two models. The SEBAL model produces larger EF and ET for most pixels than the T-s-VI triangle method when the same group of dry and wet pixels is applied, especially for pixels characterized by medium to high vegetation fractions or surface soil moisture contents. The T-s-VI triangle method is more sensitive to the surface temperatures of the dry and wet pixels than the SEBAL model. The findings from this study benefit the proper selection of end-member-based models for regional ET estimation and aid in quantifying the resultant uncertainties in the model-derived surface energy components.

TI  - A Cloud-Enabled Regional Climate Model Evaluation System
JO  - Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering
AB  - The climate research community is increasingly interested in utilizing direct, observational measurements to validate model output in an effort to tune those models to better approximate our planet's dynamic climate. The current emphasis on performing these comparisons at regional, as opposed to global, scales presents challenges both scientific and technical, since regional ecosystems are highly heterogeneous and the available data is not readily consumed on a regional basis. If provided with a common approach for efficiently accessing and utilizing the existing observational datasets, climate researchers have the potential to effect lasting societal, economic and political benefits. A key challenge, however, is that model-to-observational comparison requires massive quantities of data and significant computational capabilities. Further complicating matters is the fact that, currently, observational data and model outputs exist in a variety of data formats, utilize varying degrees of specificity and resolution, and reside in disparate, highly heterogeneous data systems. In this paper we present a software architectural approach that leverages the advantages of cloud computing and modern open-source software technologies to address the regional climate modeling problem. Our system, dubbed RCMES, is highly scalable and elastic, allows for both local and distributed management of the satellite observations and generated model outputs, and delivers this information to climate researchers in a way that is easily integrated into existing climate simulations and statistical tools. © 2011 ACM.

TI  - A Novel Forecasting Model For Wind Speed Assessment Using Sentinel Family Satellites Images And Machine Learning Method
JO  - Renewable Energy
AB  - Wind energy produced in near and offshore farms is constantly increasing, mainly thanks to the use of new technologies and the economic costs decrease. Data coming from satellites recently launched can be effectively used in near and offshore areas for wind speed mapping, and long and short-term analyses of wind regimes. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence methods is constantly increasing for predicting wind energy production. In this framework, a new forecasting model for wind speed assessment is presented integrating Sentinel satellite imagery analysis, in two phases using multi-sensor satellites, and machine learning methods. In the first step, wind speed and bathymetry have been analysed by means of sentinel-1 (S-1) and sentinel-2 (S-2) satellites images, respectively. Furthermore, a hybrid forecasting model has been proposed to assess and predict wind speed. The machine learning model consists of an integrated model using generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The new developed method has been then applied to assess wind energy potential around the Favignana island in Sicily, Italy. The results show that all the important primary parameters for a wind farm installations potential analysis, such as wind speed, water depth, and distance to the shoreline can be successfully analysed in a possible short time and freely. The following results have been obtained testing the new method: i) S-1 and S-2 satellite images have good potential for near and offshore wind speed assessment and bathymetry detection around Favignana island, ii) the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed forecasting model using the whole dataset are 0.0205, 0.0159, and 6.8385 respectively, iii) the proposed forecasting model for wind speed has higher accuracy than other valid models. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Identifying Suitable Locations For Mangrove Plantation Using Geospatial Information System And Remote Sensing
JO  - ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
AB  - Mangroves provide numerous environmental benefits, such as carbon sequestration, water purification, climate change mitigation, and flood and Tsunami impact reduction. Despite these unique advantages, mangroves are threatened by the combined adverse impacts of human activities and climate change. Therefore, it is essential to implement reasonable practices to avoid further degradation of mangroves and provide efficient workflows to increase their extent. Accordingly, better plantation policies are principally required for their conservation and rehabilitation. In this study, we desired to detect suitable locations for mangrove plantation in coastal areas of Hormozgan Province, Iran. We considered a relatively new Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique to combine ten criteria derived from remote sensing in a GIS environment. The Best Worst Method (BWM), as an MDCM technique, was implemented to determine the relative importance of each criterion. Afterward, all criteria were aggregated using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method to produce a mangrove plantation suitability map. Statistical measures, including Overall Accuracy (OA = 95%), Kappa Coefficient (KC = 87.9%), and Area Under Curve (AUC = 98.79%), indicated the high applicability of the implemented method for mangrove plantation site allocation. The produced map could give managers a profound insight into finding optimal spots to plant mangroves. © Author(s) 2023. CC BY 4.0 License.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Based Monitoring System For Discrimination Between Climate And Human-Induced Vegetation Change In Central Asia
JO  - MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of taking into account precipitation and the vegetation response to it when trying to analyse changes of vegetation cover in drylands with high inter-annual rainfall variability. Design/methodology/approach - Linear regression models were used to determine trends in NDVI and precipitation and their interrelations for each pixel. Trends in NDVI that were entirely supported by precipitation trends were considered to impose climate-induced vegetation change. Trends in NDVI that were not explained by trends in precipitation were considered to mark human-induced vegetation change. Modelling results were validated by test of statistical significance and by comparison with the data from higher resolution satellites and fieldtrips to key test sites. Findings - More than 26 percent of all vegetated area in Central Asia experienced significant changes during 1981-2000. Rainfall has been proved to enforce most of these changes (21 percent of the entire vegetated area). The trends in vegetation activity driven by anthropogenic factor are much scarcer and occupy about 5.75 percent of the studied area. Practical implications - Planners, decision makers and other interest groups can use the findings of the study for assessment and monitoring land performance/land degradation over dry regions. Originality/value - The study demonstrates the importance of taking into account precipitation and the vegetation response to it when trying to analyse changes of vegetation cover in drylands with high inter-annual rainfall variability.

TI  - Eco-Friendly Coffee-Based Colloid For Performance Augmentation Of Solar Stills
JO  - Process Safety and Environmental Protection
AB  - Recently, nanofluids have been extensively used in water desalination systems because of their superior photo-thermal properties and heat transfer characteristics. Most of inorganic nanoparticles such as metal, metal oxides and carbon have adverse environmental impacts due to the risk related to their production and disposal processes as well as the toxicity of some types of them. In addition, their high production cost is another issue that motivates researchers to find low cost and eco-friendly alternatives to inorganic nanoparticles. In this study, coffee-based colloid has been proposed as an organic, low cost, and eco-friendly alternative to conventional inorganic-based nanofluids to augment the fresh water productivity of solar stills (SS). The performance of the modified solar still (MSS) has been experimentally investigated and compared with another conventional solar still (CSS) under the same conditions. The daily freshwater productivity obtained from the MSS was 4865.73 ml/m2 which was greater than that of CSS by 35.14 %. Energy and exergy efficiencies of MSS were improved by 35.34 % and 46.44 %, respectively, compared with that of CSS. Finally, the economic evaluation of the MSS is carried out via performing cost analysis. The cost of distilled water per liter produced by the modified solar still is 0.0136 $/l. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

TI  - Mapping Deforestation And Recovery Of Tropical Montane Forests Of East Africa
JO  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Deforestation poses a major threat to the tropical montane forest ecosystems of East Africa. Montane forests provide key and unique ecological and socio-economic benefits to the local communities and host diverse flora and fauna. There is evidence of ongoing deforestation and forest clearance in these montane forests although estimates diverge among different sources suggesting rates of 0.4\%-3\% yr(-1). Quantifying deforestation rates and forest disturbance is critical to design conservation and sustainable management policies for forest management. This study quantified the rate of deforestation and forest recovery over the last three decades for the Mau Forest Complex and Mount Elgon forests in Kenya and Uganda using Landsat time-series satellite imagery. With the analysis, classification accuracies of 86.2\% and 90.5\% (kappa 0.81 and 0.88) were achieved for the Mau Forest Complex and the Mt Elgon forests, respectively. 21.9\% (88,493 ha) of the 404,660 ha of Mau forest was lost at an annual rate of -0.82\% yr(-1) over the period between 1986 and 2017. More positively, 18.6\% (75,438 ha) of the forest cover that was disturbed during the same period and is currently undergoing recovery. In Mt Elgon forest, 12.5\% (27,201 ha) of 217,268 ha of the forest cover was lost to deforestation at an annual rate of -1.03\% yr(-1) for the period between 1984-2017 and 27.2\% (59,047 ha) of the forest cover disturbed is undergoing recovery. The analysis further demonstrated agriculture (both smallholder and commercial) was the main driver of forest cover loss in Mau forest, accounting for 81.5\% (70,612 ha) of the deforestation, of which 13.2\% was due to large scale and 68.3\% was related to the smallholders. For the Mt Elgon forest, agriculture was also the main driver accounting for 63.2\% (24,077 ha) of deforestation followed by the expansion of human settlements that contributed to 14.7\% (5,597 ha) of forest loss. This study provides accurate and novel estimates of the rate of deforestation for the Mau forest complex and Mt Elgon forest ecosystems. These rates are higher than previously estimated and recent deforestation has been identified, which provides a quantitative basis for forest restoration programs and to design conservation policies.

JO  - Mechanisms and Machine Science
AB  - In this article, the deployment problem of LEO satellite communication is investigated and analyzed by the financial tool, i.e. real option theory. Traditional methods often neglect the existence of uncertainty and underestimates the value of staged deployment decisions. Real option theory pays more attention to the value of flexibility in large-scale complex engineering system, such as satellite constellation. The objective of this work is to analyze the flexible approach of staged deployment for mega-constellation and deduce the option price equations. Finally, a simple example is given to demonstrate the fact that staged deployment brings the flexibility for the system and real option theory can evaluate this value more exactly. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network -Support Vector Machine Model-Gaussian Process Regression: A New Machine Model For Predicting Monthly And Daily Rainfall
JO  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB  - Rainfall prediction is an important issue in water resource management. Predicting rainfall helps researchers to monitor droughts, surface water and floods. The current study introduces a new deep learning model named convolutional neural network (CONN)- support vector machine (SVM)- Gaussian regression process (GPR) to predict daily and monthly rainfall data in Terengganu River Basin, Malaysia. The CONN-SVM-GRP model can extract the most important features automatically. The main advantage of the new model is to reflect the uncertainty values in the modelling process. The lagged rainfall values were used as the input variables to the models. The proposed CONN-SVM-GRP model successfully decreased the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of other models by 5.9\%-23\% at the daily scale and 20\%-61\% at the monthly scale. The CONN-SVM-GRP model also provided the lowest uncertainty among other models, making it a reliable tool for predicting data points and intervals. Hence, it can be concluded that CONN-SVM-GRP model contributes to the sustainable management of water resources, even when satellite data is unavailable, by using lagged values to predict rainfall. Additionally, the model extracts important features without using preprocessing methods, further improving its efficiency. Overall, the CONN-SVM-GRP model can help researchers predict rainfall, which is essential for monitoring water resources and mitigating the impacts of droughts, floods, and other natural disasters.

TI  - Mapping Outburst Floods Using A Collaborative Learning Method Based On Temporally Dense Optical And Sar Data: A Case Study With The Baige Landslide Dam On The Jinsha River, Tibet
JO  - Remote Sensing
AB  - Outburst floods resulting from giant landslide dams can cause devastating damage to hundreds or thousands of kilometres of a river. Accurate and timely delineation of flood inundated areas is essential for disaster assessment and mitigation. There have been significant advances in flood mapping using remote sensing images in recent years, but little attention has been devoted to outburst flood mapping. The short‐duration nature of these events and observation constraints from cloud cover have significantly challenged outburst flood mapping. This study used the outburst flood of the Baige landslide dam on the Jinsha River on 3 November 2018 as an example to propose a new flood mapping method that combines optical images from Sentinel‐2, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Sentinel‐1 and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). First, in the cloud‐free region, a comparison of four spectral indexes calculated from time series of Sentinel‐2 images indicated that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the threshold of 0.15 provided the best separation flooded area. Subsequently, in the cloud‐covered region, an analysis of dualpolarization RGB false color composites images and backscattering coefficient differences of Sentinel‐1 SAR data were found an apparent response to ground roughness’s changes caused by the flood. We carried out the flood range prediction model based on the random forest algorithm. Training samples consisted of 13 feature vectors obtained from the Hue‐Saturation‐Value color space, backscattering coefficient differences/ratio, DEM data, and a label set from the flood range prepared from Sentinel‐2 images. Finally, a field investigation and confusion matrix tested the prediction accuracy of the end‐of‐flood map. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 92.3%, 0.89 respectively. The full extent of the outburst floods was successfully obtained within five days of its occurrence. The multi‐source data merging framework and the massive sample preparation method with SAR images proposed in this paper, provide a practical demonstration for similar machine learning applications using remote sensing. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Higher Temporal Evapotranspiration Estimation With Improved Sebs Model From Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Data
JO  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable in hydrologic cycle that directly affects the redistribution of precipitation and surface balance. ET measurements with high temporal resolution are required for coupling with models of highly dynamic processes, e.g., hydrological and land surface processes. The Haihe River Basin is the focus of China's industrial base and it is one of the three major grain-producing regions within the country. However, this area is facing serious water resource shortages and water pollution problems. The present study used geostationary satellite remote sensing data, in situ meteorological observations, and the surface energy balance system (SEBS) model with a new kB(-1) parameterization to estimate 3-hourly and daily energy and water fluxes in the Haihe River Basin. The results of the SEBS model were validated with point-scale data from five observation flux towers. Validation showed that 3-hourly and daily ET derived from the SEBS model performed well (R-2 = 0.67, mean bias = 0.027 mm/h, RMSE = 0.1 mm/h). Moreover, factors influencing ET were also identified based on the results of this study. ET varies with land cover type and physical and chemical properties of the underlying surface. Furthermore, ET is also controlled by water availability, radiation, and other atmospheric conditions. It was found that ET had strong correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Specifically, daily ET fluctuated with the NDVI when the NDVI was <0.29, and ET increased rapidly as the NDVI increased from 0.29 to 0.81. For NDVI values >0.81, indicating a state of saturation, the rate of increase of ET slowed. This research produced reliable information that could assist in sustainable management of the water resources and in improved understanding of the hydrologic cycle of the Haihe River Basin.

TI  - Ppp Models For The Benefit Of Sustainable Space-Based Services - New Funding Mechanisms For Developing Integrated Space-Based Applications
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
AB  - In recent years a number of space-related Public Private Partnerships (PPP) have been successfully initiated, for example in the field of satellite communication (e.g. Skynet, Alphasat, and Hylas) as well as Earth observation (e.g. TerraSAR-X). These initiatives represent a coordinated public and private European response to the increased market demand and have shown the potential of PPPs for the development of future space-based scrvices. The necessity to continuously interact with the finance community to highlight the benefits and risks associated with the development of space-based application markets, together with the need of assessing new funding schemes, is becoming an important element to link the space sector to economic growth. The estimate of the potential market involving satellite-based services is many times greater than the initial costs associated with the development of the satellite infrastructure. In this context, PPPs and PFIs (Private Finance Initiative) schemes are increasingly used to develop markets and operate space based services, whether for commercial or institutional customers. ESA's Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) programme is a newly created instrument for developing sustainable space-based services on a regional, European and global scale, in strong cooperation with end-users and relevant stakeholders. The programme aims at bringing space-based solutions to new terrestrial markets, federating new communities of users and optimising the exploitation of space assets. Integrated applications are benefiting European industrial competitiveness, while serving the needs of European societies and global communities. This paper includes the main outcome of an ESPI workshop organised in the frame of ESA's IAP programme, dedicated to how to foster the involvement of new sources of funding for the development of space-based sustainable services. It assesses different funding mechanisms applicable to ESA's IAP programme and seeks to identify a relevant roadmap for optimising the use of financing models for future space-based services. Furthermore, the paper aims at identifying and analysing the relevant economic, financing, and legal factors. Copyright © (2012) by the International Astronautical Federation.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation Between Remote Sensor And In Situ Data For Predicting The Trophic State Index From Chlorophyll “A”
JO  - Revista Brasileira de Geografia Fisica
AB  - Contamination or water pollution generates several phenomena, one of which is eutrophication. As a result, with the aim of sustainable management of water resources, the Trophic State Index was developed to enable the classification of water resources in different degrees of trophicity, with remote sensing being one of the tools capable of determining such an index. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the trophic levels obtained through remote sensing analyzes with limnological analyzes of Sample of chlorophyll “a” in the laboratory. This research consists of three stages of analysis, first a water sample will be collected along seven points in the bay of Portel-PA, which in turn will be laboratory results, then the collection and treatment of satellite images will be carried out. for the prediction of chlorophyll “a”, and then the qualitative comparison of the values obtained with the previous steps through the IET. The application of the methodology allowed observing that at all points the TSI values verified by remote sensing are close to the analysis carried out in the laboratory, with the predominant classification among the points being mesotrophic. Therefore, spatial analyzes such as this one, demonstrate the importance of remote sensing as a tool for identifying the areas of occurrence of chlorophyll“a”, however, as remote sensing techniques used in this work, they were not able to replace field work. They only allowed a more efficient remote planning and monitoring of the actions to be carried out in the final stage. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. All rights reserved.

The sea ice information extracted from satellite imagery is used together with weather data for vessel navigation in or near the ice or for increased safety and reduced risk during critical operations. Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) has ordering, downlink and processing capabilities for all the commercial and free SAR satellites in orbit today. SAR satellite imagery from these sources can, in addition to be used for detection and monitoring of sea ice, also be used for large scale environmental monitoring (oil spill detection) and increased maritime domain awareness (vessel detection). StormGeo is a leading weather risk provider for operations in Arctic, and has a strong focus on delivering weather decision support to marine operations. For the end-user performing ice analysis, satellite imagery can be used in addition to information such as local weather forecasts and ice information extracted from external sources. For efficient ordering of satellite imagery in ice management operations, it is important that the end-user have access to satellite tasking information such as potential temporal and spatial coverage, tasking deadlines and order status. In addition, the end-user must be able to access the relevant data as fast as possible after satellite acquisition. KSAT and StormGeo have in cooperation with Viking Supply Ships developed an end-to-end service integrating relevant ice-information and interfaces for satellite ordering, imagery access and weather information. The service is accessed through the StormGeo GUI, "Vortex," which serves as a robust and powerful tool for information access and ice management analysis. The service development has been done in the MULDIARCOS (Multi-mission Data and Information Services for Arctic Operations) project, which has been partly funded by ESA under the Integrated Application Promotion program.

TI  - Estimating Solid Waste Generation And Suitability Analysis Of Landfill Sites Using Regression, Geospatial, And Remote Sensing Techniques In Rangpur, Bangladesh
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has been a growing problem in fast-developing cities. A considerable amount of solid waste is generated daily and disposed anywhere, which creates an unhealthy environment. This study aims to develop a model to determine household solid waste (HSW) generation using multiple linear regression and identify suitable landfill sites to ensure proper MSW disposal in Rangpur City, Bangladesh. Socioeconomic variables data like average monthly income, educational level, family size, age of family head, and average HSW generation per day were collected from 381 respondents through stratified random sampling with a 95\% confidence level. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed using variables like surface water, slope, road network, and land use through GIS and remote sensing to find suitable landfill sites. Results of the model show no multicollinearity as the variance inflation factor was estimated to be less than 2 for each independent variable. Furthermore, the model provides a moderate overall fit because of the coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.661), which denotes the independent variables' predictive capability. The results also demonstrate that family size and education are the most critical variables in predicting waste generation because of the values of coefficients 122.39 and - 184.72, respectively. This study also illustrated suitable landfill sites through MCDA, which can be a useful resource for the city authority to ensure environmental sustainability by implementing effective strategies for proper MSW management.

TI  - I Ac-12-B4-7b-2-14357 A Performance Assessment Of An 1nterferometr1c Sar Network For The Equatorial Region
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
AB  - Intcrfcromctric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions employing flying formations are already playing a major role in operational bi-static remote sensing applications; viz. the TerraSAR-X and Tandcm-X formation. The user requirement for 3-D digital elevation model (DEM) imagery for application in cartography, rectification, geographic information system (G1S) and other application areas is on the rise. The equatorial region (ER) is vastly populated by developing nations that sparsely harness the benefits of space missions and are in need of affordable satellite data to assist in urban development, disaster monitoring and mitigation, o mapping and various other application areas. The ER is defined as the boundary lines of latitude between 10 N o o and 10 S of the Equator. The design of a small SAR satellite network, positioned at an inclination of 10 , with each satellite having different ascending nodes and possibly different eccentricities, thereby implementing a Pendulum configuration, offers a possible solution for providing rapid SAR data to developing nations. A bi/multistatic configuration based on a "master" satellite (transmitter/receiver) and several "slave" (receiver- only) satellites is proposed. The "slave" satellites are positioned at variable distances behind or ahead of the "master" satellite, allowing for a single pass interferometry. The requirement for high resolution data and low payload mass, informed the decision of selecting the X-band frequency for payload operations. This paper addresses the possibilities of implementing a formation of small SAR satellites in low Earth orbit, for intcrfcromctric operations over the equatorial region. It starts by considering the orbit network configuration, and then proposing a method of defining the formation envelope for the respective acrosstrack and along-track distances between two satellites flying in trailing formation. Parametric analysis of the orbital element requirements necessary to maintain the formation is then discussed and a proposed in-orbit formation configuration is described.

TI  - A Low-Cost Mobile Ground Station For Satellite Communication In Vhf Band
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
AB  - In this paper, we present the architecture and performance of a low-cost, small, mobile and easily deployable ground station to track and receive signals from amateur band satellites which operate on the VHF-band (144 MHz to 147 MHz). The proposed ground station uses a 6-dB gain monopole antenna, and a small low noise amplifier with 23 dB gain. The rest of the analog front-end is a software-defined radio receiver with a USB interface to a laptop computer. The software-defined nature of the front-end gives the station the flexibility to target satellites with diverse power, modulation and error-correcting schemes. The system is completed by open-source and freely available software for tracking satellite positions and for signal decoding and processing. We report performance evaluation results for outdoor operation. In addition, we also report our experience, performance analysis and link margin calculations for operation on an indoor environment with limited satellite visibility. These results would benefit ground station deployment in places with limited access to outdoor antennas, whether because of financial, regulatory or other restrictions. We also report results with a variety of amateur-band satellites, such as the FUNcube, Vellox-II, CANX 4 and 5, and AMSAT. Copyright © 2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

TI  - Predicting The Spatial Distribution Of Soil Mineral Particles Using Oli Sensor In Northwest Of Iran
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
AB  - Texture is one of the most important soil properties that knowledge of the spatial distribution is essential for land-use planning and other activities related to agriculture and environment protection. So, this study was performed to supply the soil texture spatial distribution using standardized spectral reflectance (ZPC1) index of Landsat 8 satellite images in the northwest of Iran. The soil sampling was performed using a random method in 145 points. Mineral soil particles including clay, silt, and sand were determined, and soil texture was calculated. In this study, Landsat 8 satellite images were used to interpolate the soil texture spatial distribution. In the first step, the principal component analysis (PCA) was obtained. Then, PCA1 was standardized using a z-score (ZPC1), and regression techniques were used to create proper relationships between ZPC1 and the primary soil particles. Then, spatial distribution of soil particles was used to create a spatially distributed map of the soil textural classes. The results showed that the standardization of the first component reduced the standard deviation of PCA1 from 23.6 to 10.8. The results of comparing ZPC1 with soil mineral components showed that with increasing the amounts of soil clay and sand, the ZPC1 value decreases and increases, respectively. The results showed that the ranges of the spatial distribution of clay and sand were similar to the laboratory-measured amounts. The results of texture class prediction using the soil texture triangle showed that the amount of similarity between the measured and predicted classes was 53.79%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - A New Pattern To Quantitatively Evaluate The Value Of Ecosystem Services In The Large-Scale Open-Pit Coal Mining Area
JO  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - IntroductionOpen-pit coal mining could disrupt the ecosystem and lead to the loss of service values for the ecosystem through direct occupation or indirect impacts on adjacent ecosystems. MethodsIn this research, we combined a new accounting system, gross ecosystem product (GEP), with spatial-temporal analyses to quantify the ecological variation and explore its driving factors in Pingshuo, a large-scale open-pit coal mining area in China. GEP is an aggregate accounting system that can summarize the value of provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services (ES) in a single monetary metric. The spatial-temporal approaches used in our study were known as exploratory spatial data analyses and interpretable models in machine learning. Both spatial and non-spatial data, including remote sensing images, meteorological data, and official statistics, were applied in the research. ResultsThe results indicated the following: (i) From 1990 to 2020, the annual average growth rates of GEP decreased from 30.78 to 9.1\%. Furthermore, the classified results of GEP revealed that the regions with rich ES quality rapidly reduced from 51.90 to 32.18\%. (ii) Spatial correlation of GEP was significant, and the degree of spatial clustering was relatively high in the mining areas. Moreover, the mining areas also continually presented concentrated high-density and hot spot areas of GEP changes. (iii) The spatial-temporal effects were notable in the relationship between GEP and three socioeconomic factors, i.e., the mining effects, human activity intensity, and gross domestic product (GDP). (iv) The win-win development for both the economy and ecological environment in Pingshuo could be realized by restricting the annual growth rate of mining areas to between 4.56 and 5.03\%. DiscussionThe accounting results and spatial-temporal analyses of GEP will contribute to the future regional sustainable development and ecosystem management in Pingshuo.

TI  - Multi-Variant Decision Support E-System For Device And Knowledge Based Intelligent Residential Environment
JO  - Technological and Economic Development of Economy
AB  - Intelligent housing is a novelty in Lithuania yet. Such housing is not popular in our country. Specialists of automation claim that such situation occurred not only because people lack knowledge but also because the concept of intelligent housing is interpreted erroneously (most people think that remotely controlled door of garage, for instance, makes their housing intelligent). Intelligent helpers started to emerge in households only recently. Intelligent ambient assisted environment model, created by authors, helps to evaluate intelligent ambient assisted environment by social, cultural, political, legal, economical, technological and environmental factors analysis. Basing on this model also ambient assisted environment supply and demand as well as various criteria evaluation, the system able to select the best intelligent devices alternatives accordingly to each family needs was created.Through analysis of separate parts of an existing household, it is possible to distinguish intelligent devices that I study, ie intelligent lock, intelligent robot-cleaner, intelligent infant respiratory monitor, intelligent sentinel and intelligent keyboard. Users of intelligent devices are families of young people, who want to save time and who appreciate convenience and innovations. Advantages and benefits of devices used by families of young people are being analysed. In order to provide the best guarantee for rational selection of variants of intelligent devices, decisions must be based on the system of criteria which describes variants of intelligent devices, the decision support system must reflect consumer requirements to the best possible extent, and the data provided in the system must be real and updated easily. Computer and internet technologies, multi-variant evaluation methods as well as principles and requirements applicable to favourable residential environment are combined to achieve this goal.

TI  - Geostatistical Approach To Assess Mangrove Spatial Variability: A Bi-Decadal Scenario Over Raigarh Coast Of Maharashtra
JO  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The present study aims at assessing the bi-decadal scenario related to the spatial variability of Mangroves over Raigarh district by adopting Geostatistical approach. Landsat TM/OLI data for the year 2000 and 2019 were employed for the study. Methodology adopted, involve computation and plotting of Semi-variogram (in 'R') with NDVI data, which was extracted for 28 homogeneous mangrove patches. These patches, based on similarity of Semi-variogram components, were further classified into clusters. Semi-variogram pattern for the year 2000 revealed a low range and high sill, indicating greater variation in the dataset that was correlated for a shorter distance. While in the year 2019, the Semi-variogram obtained for the same mangrove patches, exhibited high range and low sill. This clearly indicates a high spatial correlation associated with relatively low variation within the data. During the year 2019, some patches have shown evidences of exponential growth of mangroves that were represented by higher NDVI values, which were more similar, correlated and dependent. Overall rise in NDVI value indicates that the health status of mangroves has increased in 2019 along with natural expansion of mangrove colony. Over bi-decadal time span, mangrove ecology has also improved corresponding to higher NIR reflectance. The present research can be implemented to mangrove management and conservation purpose as this technique reveals the spatial dependency in the dataset.

TI  - Challenges And Opportunities Of Area-Based Conservation In Reaching Biodiversity And Sustainability Goals
JO  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Area-based conservation is essential to safeguard nature’s diversity. In view of expanding human land use, increasing climate change and unmet conservation targets, area-based conservation requires efficiency and effectiveness more than ever. In this review, I identify and relate pressing challenges to promising opportunities for effective and efficient protected area governance and management, to enhance research, decision-making and capacity building in area-based conservation under uncertain future developments. I reveal that protected area management is particularly challenged by human land use, climate change, invasive species, and social, political and economic limitations. Protected area management often lacks the continuous availability of data on current states and trends of nature and threats. Biocultural conservation, climate-smart management and biosecurity approaches help to overcome challenges induced by human needs, climate change and invasive species, respectively. Economic valuation and shifts in funding priorities can boost protected area effectiveness and efficiency. In-situ monitoring techniques, remote sensing and open data infrastructures can fill data and information gaps for protected area planning and management. Moreover, adaptive management is an auspicious concept in the framework of systematic conservation planning to ensure the enduring effectiveness of protected areas despite unpredictable future developments. Post-2020 international biodiversity and sustainable development goals could be met earlier if protected areas were more effective. I consequently conclude with the need for a global information system that is to support area-based conservation by synthesizing challenges and opportunities for protected area management effectiveness and efficiency at the local to global level. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Up-Scaling Fuel Hazard Metrics Derived From Terrestrial Laser Scanning Using A Machine Learning Model
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The characterisation of fuel distribution across heterogeneous landscapes is important for wildfire mitigation, validating fuel models, and evaluating fuel treatment outcomes. However, efficient fuel mapping at a landscape scale is challenging. Fuel hazard metrics were obtained using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and the current operational approach (visual fuel assessment) for seven sites across south-eastern Australia. These point-based metrics were then up-scaled to a continuous fuel map, an area relevant to fire management using random forest modelling, with predictor variables derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), Sentinel 2A images, and climate and soil data. The model trained and validated with TLS observations (R-2 = 0.51 for near-surface fuel cover and 0.31 for elevated fuel cover) was found to have higher predictive power than the model trained with visual fuel assessments (R-2 = -0.1 for the cover of both fuel layers). Models for height derived from TLS observations exhibited low-to-moderate performance for the near-surface (R-2 = 0.23) and canopy layers (R-2 = 0.25). The results from this study provide practical guidance for the selection of training data sources and can be utilised by fire managers to accurately generate fuel maps across an area relevant to operational fire management decisions.

TI  - Exploring The Spatial Interplay Between Built-Up Environments And Surface Urban Heat Island Phenomena In The Main Urban Area Of Shanghai
JO  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The urban built-up environment, consisting of buildings, roads, and various facilities, plays a crucial role in forming surface urban heat islands (SUHI). This study aims to address this issue by creating a comprehensive indicator system for the urban built-up environment, drawing from previous research. By employing multi-source data and diverse geospatial processing methods, this article examine the influence of 20 environmental factors on the spatial and temporal variability of SUHI in Shanghai during the summer and winter seasons from 2016 to 2020. This article findings reveal four key observations. (1) The average SUHI intensity in Shanghai's main urban area during the summers of 2016-2020 showed an increasing trend, with the heat island's shape and location differing between seasons. (2) The correlation values (R-values) between the built and road environment indicators and SUHI changed with season and year, reflecting the dynamic interplay among urban morphology, weather conditions, and human activities that affect heat generation and dissipation. (3) This article found that the increasing SUHI trend was not solely dependent on changes in individual built-up environment parameters. (4) This article analysis demonstrated that the built environment factor significantly influenced heat island intensity in summer, while the green space environment factor had a substantial impact during winter. In conclusion, the results emphasize the complex relationship between the urban built-up environment and SUHI, highlighting the need to consider various environmental factors when assessing their impact on SUHI formation. This study offers valuable insights to inform the development of effective strategies for mitigating the negative effects of SUHI on urban environments and promoting sustainable urban development.

TI  - Mapping And Monitoring Zero-Deforestation Commitments
JO  - BIOSCIENCE
AB  - A growing number of companies have announced zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs) to eliminate commodities produced at the expense of forests from their supply chains. Translating these aspirational goals into forest conservation requires forest mapping and monitoring (M\&M) systems that are technically adequate and therefore credible, salient so that they address the needs of decision makers, legitimate in that they are fair and unbiased, and scalable over space and time. We identify 12 attributes of M\&M that contribute to these goals and assess how two prominent ZDC programs, the Amazon Soy Moratorium and the High Carbon Stock Approach, integrate these attributes into their M\&M systems. These programs prioritize different attributes, highlighting fundamental trade-offs in Met.M design. Rather than prescribe a one-sizefits-all solution, we provide policymakers and practitioners with guidance on the design of ZDC M\&M systems that fit their specific use case and that may contribute to more effective implementation of ZDCs.

TI  - Using U-Net-Like Deep Convolutional Neural Networks For Precise Tree Recognition In Very High Resolution Rgb (Red, Green, Blue) Satellite Images
JO  - Forests
AB  - Very high resolution satellite imageries provide an excellent foundation for precise mapping of plant communities and even single plants. We aim to perform individual tree recognition on the basis of very high resolution RGB (red, green, blue) satellite images using deep learning approaches for northern temperate mixed forests in the Primorsky Region of the Russian Far East. We used a pansharpened satellite RGB image by GeoEye-1 with a spatial resolution of 0.46 m/pixel, obtained in late April 2019. We parametrized the standard U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained it in manually delineated satellite images to solve the satellite image segmentation problem. For comparison purposes, we also applied standard pixel-based classification algorithms, such as random forest, k-nearest neighbor classifier, naive Bayes classifier, and quadratic discrimination. Pattern-specific features based on grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) were computed to improve the recognition ability of standard machine learning methods. The U-Net-like CNN allowed us to obtain precise recognition of Mongolian poplar (Populus suaveolens Fisch. ex Loudon s.l.) and evergreen coniferous trees (Abies holophylla Maxim., Pinus koraiensis Siebold & Zucc.). We were able to distinguish species belonging to either poplar or coniferous groups but were unable to separate species within the same group (i.e. A. holophylla and P. koraiensis were not distinguishable). The accuracy of recognition was estimated by several metrics and exceeded values obtained for standard machine learning approaches. In contrast to pixel-based recognition algorithms, the U-Net-like CNN does not lead to an increase in false-positive decisions when facing green-colored objects that are similar to trees. By means of U-Net-like CNN, we obtained a mean accuracy score of up to 0.96 in our computational experiments. The U-Net-like CNN recognizes tree crowns not as a set of pixels with known RGB intensities but as spatial objects with a specific geometry and pattern. This CNN’s specific feature excludes misclassifications related to objects of similar colors as objects of interest. We highlight that utilization of satellite images obtained within the suitable phenological season is of high importance for successful tree recognition. The suitability of the phenological season is conceptualized as a group of conditions providing highlighting objects of interest over other components of vegetation cover. In our case, the use of satellite images captured in mid-spring allowed us to recognize evergreen fir and pine trees as the first class of objects (“conifers”) and poplars as the second class, which were in a leafless state among other deciduous tree species. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluation Of Urbanization Dynamics And Its Impacts On Surface Heat Islands: A Case Study Of Beijing, China
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - As the capital of China, Beijing has experienced a continued and rapid urbanization process in the past few decades. One of the key environmental impacts of rapid urbanization is the effect of urban heat island (UHI). The objective of this study was to estimate the urbanization indexes of Beijing from 1992 to 2013 based on the stable nighttime light (NTL) data derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Line Scanner System (DMSP/OLS), which has became a widely used remote sensing database after decades of development. The annual average value nighttime light Digital Number (NTL-DN), and the total lit number and urban area proportion within Beijing's boundary were calculated and compared with social-economic statistics parameters to estimate the correlation between them. Four Landsat thematic mapper (TM) images acquired in 1995 and 2009 were applied to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized land surface temperature (LSTnor), and spatial correlation analysis was then carried out to investigate the relationship between the urbanization level and NDVI and LSTnor. Our results showed a strong negative linear relationship between the NTL-DN value and NDVI; however, in contrast, a strong positive linear relationship between existed between the NTL-DN value and LSTnor. By conducting a spatial comparison analysis of 1995 and 2009, the vegetation coverage change and surface temperature difference were calculated and compared with the NTL-DN difference. Our result revealed that the regions of fast urbanization resulted in a decrease of NDVI and increase of LSTnor. In addition, choropleth maps showing the spatial pattern of urban heat island zones were produced based on different temperatures, and the analysis result indicated that the spatial distribution of surface temperature was closely related with the NTL-DN and NDVI. These findings are helpful for understanding the urbanization process as well as urban ecology, which both have significant implications for urban planning and minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization in Beijing.
