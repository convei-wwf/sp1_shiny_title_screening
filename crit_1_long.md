### 1. Societal benefits: justice, equity, and/or one of the NASA Applied Science themes

**Screening question 1: Does the context of the study relate to justice, equity, and/or one of the NASA Applied Science themes?**

(How to define "societal value" to support a meaningful and objective criterion?)

Context is relevant to societal value, encompassed within one or more of the NASA Applied Sciences themes, and/or generally relevant to equity or justice.  These themes are pretty broad and most studies are likely to satisfy this criterion.

**Rationale:** The NASA Applied Science themes provide a broad range of potential value for Earth Observation data.  While equity and justice are implicitly embedded in each of the NASA themes, they are also a stated objective of the CONVEI project, thus we make them explicit here.

**Includes:**

* [Capacity Building](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/capacity-building)
* [Climate & Resilience](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/climate-resilience)
* [Disasters](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/disasters)
* [Health & Air Quality](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/health-air-quality)
* [Water Resources](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/water-resources)
* [Ecological Conservation](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/ecological-conservation)
* [Agriculture](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/food-security-agriculture)
* [Wildland Fires](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/wildfires)
* Equity and Justice (addressing differential access to opportunities, resources, and power based on marginalized identity e.g., race, gender, religion, ethnicity, or indigenous group)

**Excludes:**

* Non-Earth-based studies (e.g., lunar, outer space)
* Studies focusing on telecommunications, navigation, military
* Studies focusing on satellite maintenance and health (e.g., battery life, orbital stability)

<!--  * Note that the "Health and Air Quality" theme should be considered more public health/epidemiology related to environmental aspects rather than e.g., individual heart health, diabetes, cancer, or diseases not related to the environment.

Commented out: this issue will be addressed by a NLP pre-screening step, and any additional documents that get through this step will not have true EO data involved and will thus be excluded by criterion 2.
