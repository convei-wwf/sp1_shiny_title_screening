### 2. Earth Observation context

**Screening question 2: Does the title and/or abstract clearly mention Earth Observation/satellite/remote sensing data?**

**Rationale:** We are seeking to identify studies that estimate the value of EO data as a primary goal or result.  Certainly there are studies that use EO data, but do not clearly state this in the title or abstract; this is a strong indication that EO data are not central to the study, and thus the valuation of such data is not likely to be a priority.

**Includes:**

* General mention of EO data, e.g., "remote observation", "remote sensing"
* Mention of a specific satellite, e.g., Sentinel-X, Terra, or MODIS
* Mention of data typical of EO sources, e.g., NDVI, Land use/land change (LULC)

**Excludes:**

* Non-Earth observation (lunar, solar), or satellites for telecommunications, navigation, military (note: this should already be excluded by criterion 1)
* GIS without specific mention of other EO context
* Spurious matches based on EO search terms, e.g., "sentinel lymph nodes" or "terra preta" (note: these should already be excluded in the NLP pre-screening)
