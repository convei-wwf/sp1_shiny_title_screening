## Screening Criteria

An ideal paper would have *valuation* of *EO data* in context of one of the *NASA Applied Science themes* as its stated purpose, and should be set aside for full text screening.  Combinations of one or two of those elements show promise and should be retained for secondary analyses.  A title/abstract that shows none of these elements should be excluded from further investigation.

### A. Valuation of data is explicit goal of document

Title and/or abstract *explicitly* describes purpose as *valuation* of *data* (not necessarily EO data) on some *objective or subjective metric of value*.

* **Valuation** is more than merely comparison or application.  
    * Comparison may result in an estimate of *relative* value, while application indicates *implicit* value (otherwise the data would not be used), but if that value metric is not explicitly stated, a document should not be included in this criterion.
    * For example, Howe et al. (2022): *Comparing Sentinel-2 And Landsat 8 For Burn Severity Mapping In Western North America*: this document compares performance of two satellite sources, but the title does not *explicitly* state on what value metric they are being compared (though the abstract may be more informative).
* Data under valuation need not be EO data nor in a NASA Applied Science context; such methods may still hold promise for application to EO/Applied Sciences.

### B. Earth Observation context

Title and/or abstract explicitly mentions Earth Observation/satellite/remote sensing data.

* This could be mentioned generally, e.g., "remote observation", "remote sensing"
* This could mention a specific satellite, e.g., Sentinel-X or MODIS
* This could mention data typical of EO source, e.g., NDVI
* **Excludes:**
    * non-Earth observation (lunar, solar), or satellites for telecommunications, navigation, military
    * On its own, mention of GIS does not qualify, and without specific mention of other EO context would be excluded
    * "Satellite" and EO terms sometime appears in non-EO contexts, e.g., *satellite* cells in cultivated meat, *remote observation* of patients at home rather than in a clinic, ... these would not count for this criterion.

### C. Societal value context

How to define "societal value" to support a meaningful and objective criterion?

* Context is relevant to societal value and/or one or more NASA Applied Sciences themes.  These themes are pretty broad and are expected to show up quite frequently.
    * [Capacity Building](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/capacity-building)
    * [Climate & Resilience](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/climate-resilience)
    * [Disasters](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/disasters)
    * [Health & Air Quality](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/health-air-quality)
    * [Water Resources](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/water-resources)
    * [Ecological Conservation](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/ecological-conservation)
    * [Agriculture](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/food-security-agriculture)
    * [Wildland Fires](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/wildfires)
* A document proposing a methodology without connection/application/reference to societal value and/or NASA Applied Sciences themes would not be included in this criterion.
* Note that the "Health and Air Quality" theme should be considered more public health/epidemiology related to environmental aspects rather than e.g., individual heart health, diabetes, cancer, or diseases not related to the environment.

### D: No criteria met

If none of the above are identified in the title, choose this.  If the document is clearly a spurious match, e.g., breast cancer screening, choose this.

### E: Uncertain how to classify

If there are questions related to how to classify a document, choose this.  This could be in conjunction with other criteria, but probably not?  This could help identify papers where current criteria are not sufficiently explained.
