**Screening question 3a: Does the title and/or abstract describe valuation of a societal benefit as a primary goal or result?**

**Includes:**

* Valuation methodology used to estimate some specific societal benefit, e.g., value of information (VOI), cost-benefit analysis, contingent valuation, revealed preference, value chain analysis, willingness to pay (WTP).
    * **Include** e.g., Ratzke, Leonie (2023) [Revealing Preferences For Urban Biodiversity As An Environmental Good](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800923001477): The author uses a revealed preference approach to estimate urban dwellers' willingness to pay for improved biodiversity.  This results in a valuation of biodiversity.
    * **Include** e.g., Perhans, K. et al. (2014) [The value of information in conservation planning: Selecting retention trees for lichen conservation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811271400022X): this paper applies a Value of Information methodology to assess the value of certain types of information on trees (lichen presence, bark and stem attributes).
* Comparison of the performance of a policy or method or data against a counterfactual (e.g., different policy, method, data, or historical baseline), for estimating some value of interest (e.g., economic benefit, conservation outcome, agricultural yield) in relative or absolute terms.
    * **Include** e.g., Howe et al. (2022): [Comparing Sentinel-2 And Landsat 8 For Burn Severity Mapping In Western North America](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/20/5249): this document compares performance of Sentinel-2 data against a counterfactual of Landsat-8 data to estimate a relative improvement in burn severity mapping.
    * **Include** e.g., Kindu, Mengistie et al. (2016) [Changes Of Ecosystem Service Values In Response To Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics In Munessa-Shashemene Landscape Of The Ethiopian Highlands](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969715312821): the authors quantify the loss of ecosystem service value (ESV) due to land use/land change, using remote observation data.
* Reduction in uncertainty around an estimate of a specific societal benefit.
    * **Include** e.g., Li, C. (2017) [Statistical Object-Based Method For Forest Change Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](http://www.linyekexue.net/EN/10.11707/j.1001-7488.20170509): the authors apply a statistical procedure to a set of satellite images to identify forest change; they apply different confidence levels to see how the detection accuracy changed.
* Mention of valuation or estimation of benefit as a primary goal (valuation methodology need not be described).

**Excludes:**

* No valuation method or result is apparent in the title or abstract.
* Valuation is mentioned in vague terms, not with respect to a specific societal benefit.
