### 3. Valuation of EO data is an explicit goal of the study

Title and/or abstract *explicitly* describes purpose as *valuation* of *Earth Observation data*.  

**Rationale:** Many studies and projects apply EO data to understand or achieve some societal benefit.  Many of these studies evaluate an outcome according to some objective or subjective metric of value, e.g., improved crop yields, improved persistence of a threatened species, increased economic efficiency of water management policy.  In such a case, the top-line result likely integrates contributions from many datasets, making it impossible to parse the value contribution of a single dataset (EO or otherwise).  Question 3a identifies value of information (though not necessarily EO data) as a primary goal.  Question 3b identifies EO data as the target of the valuation.

**Screening question 3a: Does the title and/or abstract explicitly mention valuation of information/data as a primary goal/result?**

**Includes:**

* Valuation methodology applied to one or more datasets, e.g., value of information (VOI), cost-benefit analysis, contingent valuation, revealed preference, value chain analysis, willingness to pay (WTP).  These (and variations) are all standard methodologies for estimating the value of information or data.
* Comparison of the performance of one or more datasets against a counterfactual, for estimating some value of interest (e.g., economic benefit, conservation outcome, agricultural yield) in relative or absolute terms.  The counterfactual may be another dataset or a currently used approach.
* Mention of valuation of data as a primary goal (valuation methodology need not be described).

**Excludes:**

* No valuation method is apparent in the title or abstract.
* Comparison of performance of different *models/analyses* but applied to the same dataset.  This would determine value of the *model* rather than the *data*.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Li, C. (2017) [Statistical Object-Based Method For Forest Change Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](http://www.linyekexue.net/EN/10.11707/j.1001-7488.20170509): the authors apply a statistical procedure to a set of satellite images to identify forest change; they apply different confidence levels to see how the detection accuracy changed.  But the value in improved accuracy is attributable to the changes in the model, not to the data itself.
* Valuation of some result or outcome that is not data or information.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Kindu, Mengistie et al. (2016) [Changes Of Ecosystem Service Values In Response To Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics In Munessa-Shashemene Landscape Of The Ethiopian Highlands](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969715312821): the authors quantify the loss of ecosystem service value (ESV)due to land use/land change using remote observation data.  However, the valuation is of the ESV losses, rather than the value of the *data* in determining those losses.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Sharma, Sonali et al. (2020) [A Long-Term And Comprehensive Assessment Of Urbanization-Induced Impacts On Ecosystem Services In The Capital City Of India](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590252020300283): As above, the authors value changes in ESV using EO data, but do not attempt to estimate the value of the *data* itself.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Ratzke, Leonie (2023) [Revealing Preferences For Urban Biodiversity As An Environmental Good](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800923001477): The author uses a revealed preference approach to estimate urban dwellers' willingness to pay for improved biodiversity.  This results in a valuation of biodiversity, rather than data.
* Application of data in pursuit of societal benefits/goals/insights, but with no mention of valuation of data.
    * Application indicates *implicit* value - otherwise the data would not be used!  However, this is not sufficient.  Some effort or methodology to tease out the value attributable to a set of data or information must be indicated.
    * **Exclude** E.g., Kanniah, K. D. (2016). [Multi-Sensor Satellite Data For Carbon Storage Mapping Of Green Space In A Fast Growing Development Corridor In Malaysia](https://a-a-r-s.org/proceeding/ACRS2016/ACRS%202016%20Oral%20Papers/TS9/Ab%200018.pdf): this study estimates value of carbon storage due to green space (as fraction of emitted carbon).  The study used on-the-ground sampling to parameterize allometric models of above-ground forest biomass (AGB), and then compared these to satellite imagery to estimate AGB across a broad region.  Certainly the satellite data were useful, but there is no apparent indication that the author estimated the "value added" contribution of the satellite data.

**Screening question 3b: Does the study apply the valuation methodology to EO information/data?**

**Includes:**

* Anything that passes 3a, and ties the valuation specifically to an Earth Observation dataset.
    * **Include** e.g., Howe et al. (2022): [Comparing Sentinel-2 And Landsat 8 For Burn Severity Mapping In Western North America](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/20/5249): this document compares performance of Sentinel-2 data against a counterfactual of Landsat-8 data to estimate a relative improvement in burn severity mapping.  This meets criterion 3a as it is comparing performance of one dataset against a counterfactual.  The resulting improvement in burn severity mapping is attributed to the improved spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data.
    * **Include** e.g., Fatehkia, M. et al. (2020) [The Relative Value Of Facebook Advertising Data For Poverty Mapping](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7361): This study compares satellite data against Facebook ad data for mapping socioeconomic development in India and the Philippines.  This meets criterion 3a, as the Facebook data could be considered a counterfactual to the satellite data.  The difference in performance of poverty mapping can be attributed to the use of satellite data vs. Facebook data (though the authors frame it in the opposite direction: "we evaluate the added value of using Facebook data over satellite data...").

**Excludes:**

* Anything that passes 3a, but ties the valuation to a non-EO dataset.
    * **Exclude** e.g., Perhans, K. et al. (2014) [The value of information in conservation planning: Selecting retention trees for lichen conservation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811271400022X): this paper applies a Value of Information methodology to assess the value of certain types of information on trees (lichen presence, bark and stem attributes).  The valuation is not tied to an EO dataset.  Note: this paper would not have made it past Criteria 2, as there are no EO data involved - this is just included as a counterexample for Criterion 3b.
    
<!--**EXCLUDE** E.g., Rivas-Fandino, Paula et al. (2023). ["Assessment Of High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery For Monitoring Riparian Vegetation: Riverine Management In The Smallholding"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-022-10667-8) seeks to assess the viability of satellite imagery for monitoring riparian ecosystems.  The authors show that satellite imagery can reasonably be used to estimate indices of riparian ecosystem quality, which seems valuable, but they do not offer a methodology to estimate the value of this contribution, e.g., cost effectiveness of riparian restoration.-->
