### 3. Valuation of EO data is an explicit goal or result of the study

Title and/or abstract describe a purpose or result of a study as estimation of some specific value or benefit, and that value is attributable to specific *Earth Observation data*.  

**Rationale:** Many studies and projects apply EO data to understand or achieve some societal benefit, but do not explicitly examine the contribution of the EO data to achieving that benefit/value.  Many of these studies evaluate an outcome according to some objective or subjective metric of value, e.g., improved crop yields, improved persistence of a threatened species, increased economic efficiency of water management policy.  In such a case, the top-line result usually integrates contributions from many datasets, making it impossible to parse the value contribution of a single dataset (EO or otherwise).  Even in cases where a dataset is used to measure some value or change in value over time, that change in value is not *attributable* to the data, but to changing social or environmental factors.  For purposes of CONVEI, we want to be able to attribute some benefit specifically to an EO dataset.

Question 3a asks the screener to identify whether a specific value is estimated in the study.  Question 3b asks the screener to identify whether that value is attributable to a dataset (EO or otherwise).  Question 3c asks the screener to identify whether that dataset is a specific EO dataset.
