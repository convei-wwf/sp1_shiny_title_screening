### 3. Valuation of EO data is an explicit goal or result of the study

Title and/or abstract describe a purpose or result of a study as estimation of some specific value or benefit to a defined user(s) and/or defined purpose, and that value is attributable to specific *Earth Observation data*.  

What is a *societal benefit* or *value*?  From Tadaki et al (2017): Value as a magnitude of preference, as contribution to a goal (or probably less common in academic literature, value as individual priorities or value as relations).  Value is with respect to a defined user and/or purpose.  For our purposes, that preference or goal should be linked to equity, justice, and/or one of the NASA Applied Science themes.

**Rationale:** Many studies and projects apply EO data to understand or achieve some societal benefit, but do not explicitly examine the contribution of the EO data to achieving that benefit/value.  Many of these studies evaluate an outcome according to some objective or subjective metric of value, e.g., improved crop yields, improved persistence of a threatened species, increased economic efficiency of water management policy.  In such a case, the top-line result usually integrates contributions from many datasets, making it impossible to parse the value contribution of a single dataset (EO or otherwise).  Even in cases where a dataset is used to *measure* some value or change in value over time, that change in value is not *attributable* to the data, but to changing social or environmental factors.  For purposes of CONVEI, we want to identify methods that can be used to attribute some benefit specifically to an EO dataset.

Question 3a asks the screener to identify whether a specific value is estimated in the study.  Question 3b asks the screener to identify whether that value is attributable to information or data.  Question 3c asks the screener to identify whether that information or data is EO relevant.
